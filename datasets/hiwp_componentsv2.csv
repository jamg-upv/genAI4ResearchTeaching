Hauff2022,"High-performance work practices, employee well-being, and supportive leadership: spillover mechanisms and boundary conditions between HRM and leadership behavior The aim of this paper is to deepen our understanding of the relationships between high-performance work practices (HPWPs) and employee well-being. In particular, we integrate three employee well-being types, proposing that HPWPs positively affect employee health (i.e. health status, sickness absence, and sleep quality), mediated by job satisfaction and employee engagement. We also analyze the influence of supportive leadership as a key contextual factor. We hypothesize that the positive relationships between HPWPs and employee health via job satisfaction and engagement will be reinforced by supportive leadership, since the relationships between HPWPs and a) job satisfaction and b) work engagement should be stronger when leadership is more supportive. These hypotheses are tested with representative data from German-speaking countries (Austria, Germany, and Switzerland; N = 3325). The results support the mediating roles of job satisfaction and work engagement. Interestingly, the remaining direct relationships between HPWPs and sleep quality are negative, which supports a counteracting effects model. We further find a moderating effect where, in contrast to our assumption, supportive leadership attenuates HPWPs' effects. ",art,1
Song2021,"High involvement work systems and organizational performance: the role of knowledge combination capability and interaction orientation  This study provides a theoretical model illustrating how high involvement work systems (HIWS) influence organizational performance on the knowledge combination capability perspective based on the resource-based view. We collected data from employees and managers from a sample of 147 companies, which had a total of 739 employees and 471 middle/high level managers. Our results indicate that HIWS had a significant and positive relation with organizational performance, and knowledge combination capability fully mediated its relationship. We also find that interaction orientation positively moderates the relationship between HIWS and knowledge combination capability. In addition, interaction orientation positively moderates the indirect effect of HIWS on organization creativity through knowledge combination capability. We discuss the theoretical contribution and practical implications and future studies. ",art,1
Marin 2016,"Deconstructing AMO framework: a systematic review Purpose: The AMO framework has been widely accepted in HRM literature for explaining the linkage between human resources practices and performance. However, it remains unclear whether this model has been fully demonstrated or not. Hence, we propose a systematic review that aims at identifying those investigations that have thoroughly tested the model, as well as the approaches used by them. Design/methodology/approach: Systematic literature review, filtering scientific papers published in journals indexed in Scopus, Web of Science or Google Scholar, from the year 1993 to 2016, in the field of Social Sciences and Humanities with research that indirectly apply the AMO model in their analysis. Findings: AMO model is an excellent and structured framework that provides a better understanding of the relationship between HRM and performance. Moreover, the effectiveness of the model's proposal appears to be beyond doubt. In fact, a well trained and skilled employee will perform better, and a motivated worker will be ready to ""go the extra mile"". Likewise, if the work environment does not provide adequate opportunities, both abilities and motivation might become meaningless. However, we consider that many other factors could influence the positive effects of HPWS. As a matter of fact, not only contextual factors, but also individual beliefs, personal affinities, or personal circumstances (among others) might affect the implementation of these practices and the subsequent outcomes. For this reason, we consider that developing an HRM model that perfectly fit any situation is a very complicated, if not impossible, task. Research limitations/implications: The results show a significant variability in both research approaches and variables taken into consideration. In addition, it seems that little research has been conducted to verify the AMO model directly. Therefore, we consider that there is a great need to study the model from a more systematic perspective. A thorough understanding of the model could lead to a better understanding of the problems that organizations face when implementing human resource practices. Originality/value: Our study shed light on some aspects of the AMO framework within the HRM context. Specifically, we aimed to identify whether or not it is possible to confirm the model as it was originally proposed. We also find out which HR practices and measures of performance were considered across investigations, to define a standard approach.",art,1
Ahmad2022,"The impact of green HRM on green creativity: mediating role of pro-environmental behaviors and moderating role of ethical leadership style  In the aftermath of global warming, organizations are coming under increasing pressure to reduce carbon emissions, minimize waste, and generally become more responsible in their practices. To this backdrop, researchers argue that organizational HR practices have significant potential in shaping human behaviors. Therefore, by investigating the employment of a subordinate-supervisor dyad (N = 378 (subordinates), and 141 (supervisors)), this empirical study contributes to the growing literature on Green Human Resource Management (green HRM) and its impacts on employees' green outcomes. In particular, this study tested a novel model to explore the impact of green HRM on Green Creativity (GC) of employees in mediating the role of Pro-Environmental Behaviors (PEBs) and moderating the role of Ethical Leadership Style (ELS). Data were collected from organizations in the Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) region of Pakistan. For testing the results of the proposed hypotheses, structural equation modelling technique using SMART PLS 3 was employed. The results indicate that green HRM has a positive impact on employees' GC. Furthermore, partial mediating role of PEBs was also found. Finally, it was found that the ELS moderates the relationship between green HRM and GC and between green HRM and PEBs. Several theoretical and practical implications are discussed. ",art,0
Houeland2022,"Not my task': Role perceptions in a green transition among shop stewards in the Norwegian petroleum industry  In the petroleum-dependent Norwegian economy, climate change politics challenge the powerful petroleum industry, and Norwegian shop stewards in that industry find themselves in cross-pressures of representation and responsibility. In this article, we investigate what role trade unionists in the oil sector play and can play, in a green and just transition. We analyse data from six focus group interviews with shop stewards in the petroleum industry. By engaging with theories of roles and role perceptions in light of labour agency, we fill a theoretical gap in the conceptualization of workers' collective agency. Respondents describe themselves as active part of a green transition in their capacity as workers, but the role of shop stewards neither seem to offer tools nor a mandate for representing environmental concerns: Climate change is not their task. Shop stewards respond to externally ascribed role expectations by insisting that primary agency resides with politicians, companies and consumers-and union leaders. Their reactive and ambiguous role interpretation can prove risky, as the employment outlook in the industry is changing radically and rapidly. Last, we find that there are both a need and potential for re-scripting shop stewards' role that is active and relevant in the green transition. ",art,0
Becker2022,"Surviving remotely: How job control and loneliness during a forced shift to remote work impacted employee work behaviors and well-being This paper investigates the impact of job control and work-related loneliness on employee work behaviors and well-being during the massive and abrupt move to remote work amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We draw on job-demands control and social baseline theory to link employee perceived job control and work-related loneliness to emotional exhaustion and work-life balance and posit direct and indirect effects on employee minor counterproductive work behaviors, depression, and insomnia. Using a two-wave data collection with a sample of U.S. working adults to test our predictions, we find that high job control was beneficially related to emotional exhaustion and work-life balance, while high work-related loneliness showed detrimental relationships with our variables of interest. Moreover, we find that the beneficial impact of high perceived job control was conditional on individual segmentation preferences such that the effects were stronger when segmentation preference was low. Our research extends the literature on remote work, job control, and workplace loneliness. It also provides insights for human resource professionals to manage widespread remote work that is likely to persist long after the COVID-19 pandemic. ",art,0
Burbano2022,"Mitigating Gig and Remote Worker Misconduct: Evidence from a Real Effort Experiment Employee misconduct is costly to organizations and has the potential to be even more common in gig and remote work contexts, in which workers are physically distant fromtheir employers. There is, thus, a need for scholars to better understand what employers can do to mitigate misconduct in these nontraditional work environments, particularly as the prevalence of such work environments is increasing. We combine an agency perspective with a behavioral relationship-based perspective to consider two avenues through which gig employers can potentially mitigate misconduct: (1) through the communication of organizational values and (2) through the credible threat of monitoring. We implement a real effort experiment in a gig work context that enables us to cleanly observe misconduct. Consistent with our theory, we present causal evidence that communication of organizational values, both externally facing in the form of social/environmental responsibility and internally facing in the form of an employee ethics code, decreases misconduct. This effect, however, is largely negated when workers are informed that they are being monitored. We provide suggestive evidence that this crowding out is due to a decrease in perceived trust that results from the threat of monitoring. Our results have important theoretical implications for research on employee misconduct and shed light on the trade-offs associated with various potential policy solutions. ",art,0
