# Purpose:
As scientific output grows, systematic reviews have become essential yet increasingly challenging. Our approach aims to make this process more effective, efficient and accessible to researchers worldwide, including those in developing countries.
We developed a tool to complement human judgment in the screening phase using pre-trained language models and natural language processing techniques. This tool generates text embeddings and calculates semantic similarities, prioritizing potentially relevant articles. The method was implemented using limited computational resources and open-source software, ensuring accessibility for research teams with restricted economic resources.
Results indicate a possible reduction in screening time and improved consistency in article selection. The tool demonstrated utility in classifying relevant studies and would facilitate more comprehensive reviews.
By providing a low-cost solution, we aim to level the playing field in global research, enabling researchers from diverse economic backgrounds to participate more fully in producing scientific knowledge.
