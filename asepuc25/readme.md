To download files from GitHub, there are two primary methods:

There is no direct option to download a single folder (though there is a workaround involving modifying the access URL and using a third part platform).
1. To get the following small size folder from a huge  repo: [https://github.com/jamg-upv/LLMforSLRscreening/edit/main/UBdocSchoolMAy25](https://github.com/jamg-upv/LLMforSLRscreening/edit/main/UBdocSchoolMAy25)
2. Just change only the github.com part of the URL to githubbox.com
   - [https://githubbox.com/jamg-upv/LLMforSLRscreening/blob/main/UBdocSchoolMAy25/readme.md](https://githubbox.com/jamg-upv/LLMforSLRscreening/blob/main/UBdocSchoolMAy25/readme.md)
