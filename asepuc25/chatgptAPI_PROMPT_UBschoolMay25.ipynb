The growing use of online teaching evaluations has enabled educational administrators to expand the time period during which student evaluation of teaching (SET) surveys can be completed by students. This added benefit increases the complexity of data collection and introduces new questions related to the time window during which SET survey administration should commence and stop. This article examines the role of the timing of SET survey completion on student satisfaction measures in the context of online marketing courses. The results indicate that there are significant differences between those students who respond early to survey invitations and those who respond late. Early responders and late responders reflect different segments of the student body, have different course evaluation formation dynamics, and exhibit different grade expectations. The findings suggest the existence of systematic biases in SET scores related to response rate, requiring educators to closely examine policies related to the timing of SET survey administration.\",\n          \"Background: Maternal and Child Health Aides are the largest nursing cadre in Sierra Leone providing maternal and child health care at primary level. Poor healthcare infrastructure and persistent shortage of suitably qualified health care workers have contributed to high maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality. In 2012, 50% of the MCHAides cohort failed their final examination and the Government of Sierra Leone expressed concerns about the quality of teaching within the programmes. Lack of teaching resources and poor standards of teaching led to high failure rates in final examinations reducing the number of newly qualified nurses available for deployment.Methods: A mixed-methods approach using semi-structured observations of teaching sessions and completion of a questionnaire by students was used. Fourteen MCHAide Training Schools across all districts of Sierra Leone, 140 MCHAide tutors and 513 students were included in the study. In each school, teaching was observed by two researchers at baseline, 3 and 6 months after the tutor training programme. Students completed a questionnaire on the quality of teaching and learning in their school at the same time points.Results: A total of 513 students completed the questionnaire, 120 tutors took part in the training and 66 lessons across all schools were observed. There was a statistically significant (p < 0.05) improvement in mean student evaluation of teaching and learning in 12/19 areas tested at follow-up compared to baseline. Observation of 66 teaching sessions demonstrated an increase in the number of student-focused, interactive teaching methods used.Conclusion: Prior to the teaching and learning workshops there was little student-focused learning within the schools. Teaching was conducted predominantly using lectures even for practical sessions. Training tutors to move away from didactic teaching towards a more student-focused approach leads to increased student satisfaction with teaching and learning within the schools.\",\n          \"This paper aims at verifying the measurement capacity of a tool for teaching assessment at the University of Padova (Italy).

The effectiveness of good teaching and learning in higher education depends on many critical factors. Governments, institutions and individuals continue to adapt and utilize a scheme of strategies in higher education for both sound pedagogical and real-world application. Debate and dialogue around what constitutes good teaching and good learning has led most Universities to conduct evaluations of teaching, often from multiple perspectives. Course and subject evaluations, student evaluation of teaching (SET), student feedback surveys, teaching and peer evaluations, and even informal feedback mechanisms are incorporated into many of the evaluation and measurement instruments recognized by institutions for determining the value of their teaching. Various forms of teaching evaluations may be taken out of context, or when different evaluation mechanisms are not triangulated together, we may see the distinct possibility that results may be inaccurate, distorted, misleading or even abused. Moreover, we realize that teacher effectiveness and consequently student learning may also be compromised. This paper suggests that there needs to be an alignment of the institutions goals with evaluation objectives (and consequently student learning), otherwise observations and evaluations will continue to create misunderstandings and confusion as to their suitability and value. Reflecting on teaching and learning evaluation practices observed across three international universities; this paper proposes that universities adopt a broader teaching evaluation framework that harmonizes and manages evaluations of teaching through a more coordinated, contextual and transparent approach that embraces social, individual and cultural perspectives.\",\n          \"id0673# Does the student evaluation of teaching instrument really measure instructors' teaching effectiveness? An econometric analysis of students' perceptions in economics courses. While the student evaluation of teaching (SET) has been an intensely researched area in higher education there has been little research using the individual student responses on their perceptions of instructors' effectiveness (TEVAL) score. This research delivers a methodological breakthrough as it fills this gap by employing individual student responses from an elite Australian university and partial proportional odds model to investigate the influence of students' perceptions of instructional attributes included in the SET instrument and other variables on TEVAL score. The findings indicate clear presentation and explanation, and well-organized classes were key determinants of TEVAL scores. Emphasis on thinking rather than memorizing was less influential. Intermediate level courses and non-English speaking background instructors received lower ratings. Elective courses and instructors below associate professor attracted higher ratings. SET instrument currently used fails to provide a valid measure of teaching quality as it does little to measure the extent of students' actual learning. This paper underscores the need to incorporate variables typifying diversity of student population including academic performance, discipline destination, ethno-linguistic background, age, sex, indicators of students' effort. It raises broader implications such as sub-scales, inclusion of items on course contents, intellectual challenge, real world applications, and problem-solving skills.

An investigation is reported which tests die applicability of two American instruments designed to assess tertiary students' evaluations of teaching effectiveness with 158 Nigerian undergraduates. The scales were found to have generally high internal consistency reliability coefficients, most of the items were seen to be appropriate, and every item was considered of importance by at least some of the students. In addition, all but the Workload/Difficulty items clearly differentiated between 'good' and 'poor' lecturers. Factor analysis found a strong main factor of teaching effectiveness plus a minor factor referring to course workload and difficulty. Further analysis generally supported the convergent and discriminant validity of those scales hypothesized to measure similar or dissimilar components of effective teaching. However, this analysis supported the factor analytic results as more overlap between aspects of teaching skill and enthusiasm was found than has been evident in Western studies. Thus there must be doubt about the cross-cultural validity of a multidimensional model of teaching effectiveness.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
