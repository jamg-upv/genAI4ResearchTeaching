10.4995/wpom.19631,"A noise audit of the peer review of a scientific article: a WPOM journal case study. This study aims to be one of the first to analyse the noise level in the peer review process of scientific articles. Noise is defined as the undesired variability in the judgements made by professionals on the same topic or subject. We refer to evaluative judgements in which experts are expected to agree. This is what happens when we try to judge the quality of a scientific work. To measure noise, the only information needed is to have several judgements made by different people on the same case to analyse their dispersion (what Kahneman et al. call a noise audit). This was the procedure followed in this research. We asked a set of reviewers from the journal WPOM (Working Papers on Operations Management) to review the same manuscript which had been previously accepted for publication in this journal, although the reviewers were unaware of that fact. The results indicated that if two reviewers were used, the probability of this manuscript not being published would be close to 8%, while the probability of it having an uncertain future would be 40% (one favorable opinion and one unfavorable opinion or both suggesting substantial changes). In the case of employing only one reviewer, in 25% of the cases, the audited work would have encountered significant challenges for publication. The great advantage of measuring noise is, once measured, it is usually possible to reduce it. This article concludes by outlining some of the measures which can be put in place by scientific journals to improve their peer review processes.",art

Safety and Quality Assessment for Sustainability (SQAS) is evaluation promoted by an as-sociation of chemical companies called CEFIC. Its vocation is to serve as a tool for the as-sessment of safety, quality, security, health, environmental and corporate social responsi-bility (CSR) of the logistic suppliers, but the activity of the companies that promote it can generate doubts about its instrumentalization. On the other hand, ISO 26000 offers an agreed guidance framework on social responsibility (SR). Through a comparative analysis, using the core subjects of ISO 26000 as a basis, the suitability of the SQAS evaluation in its Transport Service modality, as SR measurement tool, is tested. The analysis detects im-portant shortcomings in the SR core subjects assessed, especially those referring to human rights, moral obligations with society or stakeholder commitment and its participation, but on the other hand, the assessment stands out for its exhaustiveness in specific transporta-tion safety issues. This work contributes to contextualize the SQAS assessment as a CSR tool and identify the aspects that should be incorporated for a more effective assess of CSR. It also shows the lack of rigor of the self-regulation tools of organizations.",art

Supply Chain Agility (SCA) has recently received substantial attention in the literature and in practice. The previous literature encompasses a number of different tools and constructs that are used to measure SCA, indicating the need to refine and validate a supply chain -level measurement instrument of SCA. In addition, the role of the contextual factors inherent to the implementation of SCA and the need to achieve a certain fit between SCA and other supply chain and firm strategies and orientations has received little attention by the research community. This paper represents a SLR protocol to identify definitions,definitions, practices, and measurement items of SCA, as well as the contextual factors that affect supply chain's ability to implement and measure supply chain agility.

10.4995/wpom.16808,"What does the wage structure depend on? Evidence from the national salary survey in Spain. Purpose: This paper aims to assess extrinsic motivation in the Spanish labor market. We focus on evaluating whether remuneration programs have a sufficient prevalence in the Spanish context to be considered in research models. Besides, we are also interested in identifying which are the factors that might affect the adoption of those programs.Design/methodology/approach: We gather the data from three waves (2006, 2010, and 2014) of the salary structure survey (EES) conducted by the Spanish National Institute of Statistics (INE). We use Descriptive Statistics for identifying the incidence and intensity of remuneration programs in the Spanish context. We use the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) for exploring which factors are affecting the implementation of remuneration programs.Findings: Our results show that both degree of use and intensity of remuneration programs related to extrinsic motivation are low. There are not important differences between the three series of data. It seems that the rigidity of the Spanish labor legislation influences the salary structure. In this sense, the basic salary and fixed payments are the central part of the monthly gross amount. Finally, few of the factors under study have a substantial effect on the intensity of variable retribution.Research limitations: Our research uses only official data provided by company payroll records and many economic participation programs are grouped into a single category within the survey, which limits the possibility of analysis. In addition, the cross-sectional nature of the data limits the possibility of establishing causal relationships.Practical implications: We have concluded that remuneration programs related to extrinsic motivation are not being widely used in the Spanish context. This fact is relevant since many studies point out that employee involvement is essential for the success of organizations in the current contextOriginality/value: The importance of the study lies in its focus on the salary structure to assess whether extrinsic motivation mechanisms are used in the Spanish labor market. We have studied the salary structure composition in Spain in a disaggregated way, focusing on variable remuneration, whereas most of the previous research considers the salary as a whole (total gross salary without dividing by retribution concepts). Also, we have identified which factors are affecting the implementation of remuneration programs.mic programs. Also, we have clarified several issues related to the salary structure in Spain.",art

In today's competitive markets, the role of human resources as a sustainable competitive advantage is undeniable. Reliable hiring decisions for personnel assignation contribute greatly to a firms' success. This is especially relevant in disasters management and emergency situations where times plays a fundamental role for effective relief and the costbenefit ratio can be improved. The Personnel Assignment Problem (PAP) relies on assigning the right people to the right positions. The solution to the PAP provided in this paper includes the introducing and testing of an algorithm based on a combination of a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) and a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The evaluation of candidates is based on subjective knowledge and is influenced by uncertainty. A FIS is applied to model experts' qualitative knowledge and reasoning. Also, a GA is applied for assigning assessed candidates to job vacancies based on their competency and the significance of each position. The proposed algorithm is applied in an Iranian company in the chocolate industry. Thirty-five candidates were evaluated and assigned to three different positions. The results were assessed by ten Human Resources (HR) managers and the algorithm results proved to be satisfactory in discovering desirable solutions. Also, two GA selection techniques (tournament selection and proportional roulette wheel selection) were applied and compared. Results show that tournament selection has better performance than proportional roulette wheel selection.",art

This study was conducted to propose the Green Economic Development Plan or G.E.D. plan which may be used as guide by Small and Medium Manufacturing Enterprises or S.M.M.E.s to achieve a more competitive advantage. The researcher was inspired by the theory of sustainable development where green practitioners ensure that business processes are geared towards the preservation of the natural environment. Green practices ensure that natural environment is protected, sources of local supplies and raw materials are sustained, total costs and expenses are reduced and net income are increased, hence, businesses become more resilient and competitive. More resilient and competitive businesses contribute to economic development which will benefit the whole community. The descriptive survey method was used to gather data to determine the green initiatives that were implemented by S.M.M.E.s and were used as bases for crafting a green economic development plan or G.E.D. plan. Document analysis was also employed to obtain data from any available printed materials and records provided by the respondents. Observation was also employed to survey the assets owned and validate any green initiatives that were implemented by the S.M.M.E.s. Such methods of gathering information were used to validate data gathered from local and foreign-related literature. The findings showed that among the green initiatives implemented by S.M.M.E.s, which resulted in the reduction of total costs and expenses, were the proper disposal and segregation of waste materials, water management by recycling wastewater and using water-efficient equipment, installing energyefficient equipment, using eco-friendly packaging materials and local supplies, managing efficiently natural resources and raw materials.Having analyzed the findings it was recommended that the S.M.M.E.s should encourage active participation and support of suppliers and customers in achieving the G.E.D.'s objectives by developing incentive schemes. Furthermore, S.M.M.E.s should continue to benchmark with Green Practitioners that are operating locally and abroad to adopt best greening strategies and regularly network with concerned government agencies for continuous updating on Green Economic Development initiatives that may benefit the firm. Further research may be conducted on green initiatives implemented by small and medium enterprises in other industry sectors.",art

This paper examines the perceptions of a group of students of a Postgraduate Master's Degree in Cosmetics Industry at the Universitat de Valencia, delivered with a blended learning modality, in relation to their experience in face-to-face learning and differentiating between those with or without a previous background in a remote online learning environment, with the added purpose of identifying strategies to enhance that experience, while offering further evidence for scholars, educators and institutions in this field. To this end, a survey with open questions devised ad hoc leaning on our literature review was submitted to a group of 114 students of the Master's Degree in the period 2017-2020. Students were enquired about the pros and cons of their blended learning experience in relation to the traditional face-to-face learning, and which modality they would choose next time if both were offered, only considering the achievement, experience and satisfaction, regardless of the price. 77 students of our initial sample participated in the questionnaire, 38 of them without previous experience in blended or distance learning. The results show a certain predilection for face-to-face learning, especially in the group of newbies in blended or distance learning. They highlight how they miss a closer interaction with their peers and professors and the difficulties to assimilate certain content, while appraising the flexibility, autonomy, and the self-pace of the blended learning modality. Correspondingly, students with experience in remote online education settings generally show a better predisposal and find fewer disadvantages in blended learning. This suggests that the factor of experience and adaptation to new tools and methods improves student perception and confidence and shapes their preferences, with a foreseeable growing acceptance of blended learning in the future. Finally, the outcome allows us to define a series of strategies to improve the achievement, experience, and satisfaction of students in this learning context.",art

A Spanish version of the article is provided (see section before annex).This article proposes a 4-step model for scientific dissemination that aims to promote evidence-based professional practice in Operations Management or Human Resource Management as well as research with a more transparent and reproducible process. These 4 steps include:1 social network announcements, 2 dissemination to scientific journals, 3 dissemination to social networks, and 4 scientific dissemination to professional journals. Central to the 4-step model is a three-stage publication process within the second step, which adds an additional stage to the two previously proposed (Marin-Garcia, 2015). These three publication stages begin with a protocol paper, are followed by a data paper, and finish with a traditional article. Each stage promotes research with merit which is citable and recognizable as such before the scientific evaluation bodies. As two of these stages are largely unknown within the fields of Business and Management, I define the details of a protocol paper and a data paper including their contents. In addition, I provide examples of both papers as well as the other steps of the science dissemination model. This model can be adopted by researchers as a means of achieving greater impact and transfer of research results. This work intends to help researchers to understand, to evaluate, and to make better decisions about how their research reaches society at large outside of academia.In this way, WPOM aligns with the recommendations of several leading journals in the field of business management on the need to promote transparent, accessible, and replicable science (Beugelsdijk et al., 2020). WPOM goes one step further in compliance with this direction by having relevant journals that not only accept, but also actively encourage the publication of protocol papers and data papers. WP0.4,1 strives to pioneer in this field of Business and Management.This article also explores the potential prevalence ofprotocol papers and data papers within the set of all articles published in journals indexed in Clarivate Web of Science and Scopus.With this editorial, WPOM is committed to promoting this model by accepting for review any of the three types of scientific contributions including protocol papers, data papers, and traditional papers.SDGs' supported by research: SDG08 Decent Work and Economic Growth",art

They were based on the evolution of the pandemic between September 2020 and March 2021, a period that included two complete waves of the pandemic.Contrary to expectation and despite the European and national transparency laws (BOE-A2013-12887, 2013; European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2019), the actual COVID-19 pandemic-related data, at least in Spain, took considerable time to be updated and made available (usually a week or more). Moreover, some relevant data necessary to develop and validate hospital bed management models were not publicly accessible. This was either because these data were not collected, because public agencies failed to make them public (despite having them indexed in their databases), the data were processed within indicators and not shown as raw data, or they simply published the data in a format that was difficult to process (e.g., PDF image documents versus CSV tables). Despite the potential of hospital information systems, there were still data that were not adequately captured within these systems.Moreover, the data collected in a hospital depends on the strategies and practices specific to that hospital or health system. This limits the generalization of real data, and it encourages working with realistic or plausible data that are clean of interactions with local variables or decisions (Gunal, 2012; Marin-Garcia et al., 2020). Besides, one can parameterize the model and define the data structure that would be necessary to run the model without delaying till the real data become available. Conversely, plausible data sets can be generated from publicly available information and, later, when real data become available, the accuracy of the model can be evaluated (Garcia-Sabater and Maheut, 2021).This work opens lines of future research, both theoretical and practical. From a theoretical point of view, it would be interesting to develop machine learning tools that, by analyzing specific data samples in real hospitals, can identify the parameters necessary for the automatic prototyping of generators adapted to each hospital. Regarding the lines of research applied, it is evident that the formalism proposed for the generation of sound patients is not limited to patients affected by SARS-CoV- 2 infection. The generation of heterogeneous patients can represent the needs of a specific population and serve as a basis for studying complex health service delivery systems.",art
10.3926/ic.2513,"Factors affecting virtual work arrangements and organizational performance: Assessed within the context of Nepalese organizations. Purpose: Virtual business has great potential, and excellent work management is vital to the next generation's thinking. This study examined the factors affecting virtual work arrangements (VWAs) in Nepalese enterprises, providing a unique viewpoint on remote work in an emerging market. Design/methodology/approach: The study utilized a quantitative research methodology, employing a sample size of 408 individuals engaged in a virtual work environment. It conducted empirical research to examine the impact of communication satisfaction (CS), job satisfaction (JS), support in computer anxiety (CA), and personal empowerment (PE) on OP. Findings: The study found that CS was the most predictive of improved OP among the variables tested. Furthermore, PE had a favorable effect on OP, suggesting that organizational outcomes also improve when people feel empowered. While there was a positive correlation between CA and OP, it was not statistically significant. Such findings mean that CA may not strongly support a higher OP. On the other hand, within Nepalese VWAs, JS displayed a weak and negative correlation with OP. Research implications/originality value: By examining this relatively unexplored domain, the research aims to offer a more comprehensive grasp of VWAs, accommodating specific circumstances in Nepal and generating significant insights that can be applied globally to remote work strategies. The study's theoretical implications emphasize the importance of tailored CA methods to improve acceptance of VWAs. Integrating the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) highlights the significance of empowering virtual workers by emphasizing autonomy, competence, and relatedness to encourage proactive behavior and innovative problem-solving. As for practical implications, the study suggests that promoting effective communication and digital technology, reducing computer anxiety, and promoting empowerment can boost technology uptake and proactive attitudes in virtual work settings, improving OP.",art
10.3926/ic.2408,"The effect of subjective well-being at work in successful organizational management. Purpose: The objective of this research was to analyze the effect of subjective well-being on successful organizational management through the study and measurement of the variables: quality of work life, job satisfaction and happiness at work. Design/methodology/approach: This research has a positivist or quantitative approach of a correlational type at a descriptive level and corresponds to a population sample of 302 workers randomly selected from a total of nine hundred collaborators hired by the Universities of Barranquilla, Colombia. Findings: In order to predict the behavior of a dependent variable based on other independent variables, the multiple regression model was used, so the statistical data indicate that subjective well-being index can increase or decrease in organizations and derives from the perception of quality of work life of employees. In this research, job satisfaction was the factor with the highest score, followed by the quality of work life variable, then happiness at work, and due to these factors, subjective Wellbeing at work is generated. The conclusions of the research denote the importance for organizational management to know the perception of workers. The data generated through this measurement will allow companies to personalize their work well-being programs, and to invest better in their logistical and human economic resources, as well as how to create business strategies that promote higher levels of commitment and work productivity, this diagnostic measurement model helps human talent areas to be more aligned with the real needs and expectations of employees. The analysis of the study concludes that the development of strategies to improve the subjective well-being of employees promotes successful organizational management. Originality/value: This research analyzes subjective well-being at work, because most of the studies carried out on this topic focus on subjective well-being from a personal perspective, emphasizing how citizens evaluate their lives in general terms. This article is focused on aspects related to the perception of workers in the work context based on the measurement of three variables in an integrated manner; In general, other research has analyzed the variables individually and related them to other aspects such as the work environment or productivity. The originality of this study lies in the integrated analysis of the three variables quality of work life, satisfaction and happiness at work as predictors of SWB at work. The data from this measurement model provides relevant information so that organizations can make better decisions regarding their policies for attraction, loyalty and retention of human capital, in this way they can design strategies, create incentive and benefit plans, according to the employee's expectations and needs.",art

Purpose: This study analyses some of the aspects that contribute to the better performance of Mondragon Corporation compared to other cooperatives and to the rest of the companies in the Basque Country from a systemic perspective.Design/methodology: First, a systematic review of the literature on the factors that can explain the higher competitiveness of Mondragon cooperatives compared to the rest of the firms was performed. Then, a draft framework representing the existing relationship between the factors was proposed based on the previously analysed studies. Next, a contrast with five experts having different perspectives of Mondragon Corporation was made. The contributions of the experts to the proposal yielded the final framework.Findings: A framework that links the factors and establishes precondition relationships among them is proposed. This framework assigns a special role to the basic inter-cooperative agreement structure as a condition for developing intercompany synergies. Research limitations/implications: In this study, a specific case of Mondragon Corporation was analysed, and the framework was tested by a limited number of experts. This study adds a new systemic perspective to the rich literature on the factors that explain Mondragon cooperatives' competitiveness.Practical implications: This paper provides insights into the factors that should be considered when trying to replicate the experience of Mondragon Corporation in other socioeconomic contexts.Social implications: This study stresses the relevance of a shared set of values, basic agreements and governance institutions as a base for the construction of strong synergetic relationships among companies.Originality/value: The existing literature related to the key factors for Mondragon cooperatives' competitiveness analysed them from an individual factor perspective. This research advances the knowledge to understand the systemic interrelationships among them.",art

Purpose: This paper investigates the impact of organisational justice on organisational citizenship behaviour and workplace deviance and examines the mediator effect of organisational citizenship behaviour between organisational justice and workplace deviance in higher education in Malaysia.Design/methodology: This study employs a deductive approach and uses non probability, especially judgmental sampling. It analyses data of faculty members from five universities in Malaysia. SEM-PLS3 is used to examine the research model and test the mediating effect of organisational citizenship behaviour on the relationship between organisational justice and workplace deviance.Findings: The results reveal the positive impact of organisational justice on organisational citizenship behaviour and the negative effects of organisational justice on workplace deviance. Further, the study confirms the mediating effect of organisational citizenship behaviour between organisational justice and workplace deviance, especially in higher education.Practical implications: This study guides managers and administrators, especially in public higher education settings, in implementing appropriate organisational mechanisms towards improving organisational citizenship behaviour. In addition, the findings can also provide insights for other public and private organisations alike in approaching workplace deviance.Originality/value: These research findings expand knowledge on workplace deviance behaviour by providing evidence for the different impacts of organisational justice and organisational citizenship behaviour.",art
10.3926/ic.1793,"Dynamic capabilities in the tourist companies of the Colombian Caribbean Coast: Case of Cartagena de Indias. Purpose: This article aims to characterize factors of dynamic capabilities and analyze the relationship between them. The case study is particularized for the tourism sector.Design/methodology: This study has a quantitative approach. Data collection was carried out through a questionnaire applied to a sample of 136 tourism companies on the Colombian Caribbean Coast, specifically in Cartagena de Indias. For the explanation and interpretation of the information collected, multivariate factorial analysis and the Chi-square association test were used.Findings: This research reveals the association and identification of the dynamic capabilities of innovation, adaptation and absorption with the positive behavior of companies in the tourism sector of the Colombian Caribbean (Cartagena de Indias), thus becoming sources for the optimization of strategic actions that make it possible to take advantage of opportunities and mitigate threats from the dynamic environment. In addition, if these capabilities are combined with each other, they become platforms for the development of new competitive advantages, giving rise to a new dynamic capability: the systemic one.Research limitations/implications: The study only covers companies in a specific sector and geographic location. Future studies should extend the analysis too their industries and territories. Practical implications: From a management perspective, it is suggested that those responsible for making decisions in tourism companies articulately implement dynamic capabilities for the development of competitive advantages and the use of their resources.Originality/value: One of the main contributions of the research is the identification of the systemic capacity for the academic literature of the dynamic capabilities.",art
10.3926/ic.2677,"Human resource management practices and organisational performance in the Nepalese development banks: Insights from Structural Equation Modelling. Purpose: Effective human resource management (HRM) practices are essential factors that provide organizations with a competitive edge and contribute to their overall performance. This study examines the impact of HRM practices, including recruitment and selection (RS), training and development (TD), compensation policies (CPs), and performance appraisal (PA), on the organizational performance (OP) of the Nepalese development banks (DBs). Design/methodology/approach: The study followed a causal-comparative research approach. It employed a structured questionnaire to gather the necessary data from 257 working representatives of the ten selected Nepalese DBs. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to examine the association between the variables and validate the study hypotheses. Findings: The HRM practices exhibit a significant and positive association with OP (beta = 0.910; p < 0.05), indicating their influence on achieving organisational success. Such findings offer a pragmatic perspective for achieving HRM excellence and organisational effectiveness in the Nepalese DBs. Research limitations/implications: Analysis of cross-sectional data from development banks cannot be extrapolated to other sectors. This study emphasises the importance of compensation, performance measurement, hiring and selection, development, and training in improving OP, confirming and expanding prior findings. These insights may benefit policymakers, HR managers, and executives in enhancing HR operations by improving employee performance and business productivity. Originality/value: This study's unique contribution is its examination of HRM dynamics and their direct impact on OP, notably in the Nepalese DBs. The DBs may optimise their HR, enhancing OP and a long-lasting competitive advantage.",art
10.3926/ic.2208,"Job involvement and valuation of job resources: The mediating effect of satisfaction with job resources. Purpose: Using the job demands-resources (JD-R) model as a general framework, this paper has two objectives: the first, to analyse the relationship between job involvement and valuation of job resources; the second, to analyse the mediating effect of satisfaction with job resources on the relationship between job involvement and employees' valuation of job resources.Design/methodology: The survey was used as a research methodology.The participants correspond to a sample of 225 employees in Spain. The research model was tested using structural equation modelling, namely the partial least squares (PLS-SEM) technique, and SmartPLS.Findings: The hypotheses are positively contrasted. Job involvement is positively related to valuation of job resources, and satisfaction with job resources mediates the relationship between job involvement and valuation of job resources. The results of this work indicate that the most involved employees give greater importance to job resources.Originality/value: This paper evidences the relationship between job involvement and the importance that employees attribute to job resources. Therefore, this research advances the job demands-resources model, as it suggests that employees' high involvement in their job leads to greater involvement of resources, which is related to employees' psychological contract.",art
10.3926/ic.1358,"To hoard or to share?: Strategic management of knowledge and ICTS in complex economic systems. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to achieve a better understanding of the effects of strategic decisions related to the management of knowledge taken by organizations in complex economic systems. These effects are seen in the long term performance of organizations in the system choosing different strategic paths. As knowledge-related processes make intensive use of ICTs, the influence of the degree of development of these technologies is taken into account.Design/methodology: An agent-based simulation model, ImbySim, based in the I-Space conceptual framework, is used to represent the evolution of a group of knowledge-intensive organizations located in a given geographic space. Those organizations engage, among others, in processes of creation and transfer of knowledge assets. Organizations show different levels of performance, which may be related to their knowledge-related strategic choices. The main knowledge-related strategies available for the agents are, on one side, sharing or hoarding knowledge and, on the other side, structuring or destructuring knowledge.Findings: The results of the simulation suggest that it is not adequate to adopt an 'always sharing' or 'always hoarding' strategy. The hoarding or sharing of knowledge assets need to be applied in a discriminating way depending on the specific asset or the situation of the organization. Also, different levels of development of ICTs favour different strategic choices concerning the adequate structuring of knowledge assets and the degree of knowledge sharing. In general terms, ICT development calls for more sharing and more structuring of knowledge.Practical implications: The hypotheses developed from this research may be very useful, once empirically tested, for strategic planning. Policy makers in charge of complex economic systems and firms and institutions present in them may benefit from the insights obtained and define their strategic moves according to them.Originality/value: From the simulations, a number of empirically testable hypotheses have been extracted. Should these hypotheses get empirically corroborated, they would challenge a certain body of theorising-associated with organizational ecology and organizational demography-thus demonstrating the fruitfulness of the simulation approach to complex knowledge-based problems in the field of strategy.",art
10.3926/ic.1390,"Intangible assets and business results of large companies. Purpose: To analyze the main types of intangible assets as sources of economic and social outcomes in large corporations.Design/methodology: We create a sample of large corporations with data from two secondary databases: Fortune Most Admired Companies and Interbrand. We study business' legitimacy through their presence on Google.com . We perform quantitative analysis by testing the proposed hypotheses against a structural equation model built using the PLS method.Findings: We confirm the value of brands and legitimacy as sources of economic outcomes. We observe that perceived quality and brand equity influence social results. We conclude that perceived quality alone does not improve brand or market value.Research limitations/implications: The main limitation is related to the characteristics of the companies in the sample: large, highly institutionalized multinational corporations.Practical implications: The results offer several considerations for managers seeking to improve organizational outcomes. Intangible assets must be managed along with tangible assets in order for organizations to survive and thrive in the marketplace.Originality/value: The principal contribution of this study is to demonstrate the importance of managing intangible assets so that the organization can maintain or improve its legitimacy and its economic outcomes.",art
10.3926/ic.1758,"Non-financial information in IBEX 35: Comparison of voluntary vs compulsory elaboration and assurance. Purpose: Large companies are used to elaborating and verifying non-financial information voluntarily. In Spain, it is compulsorily required after Law 11/2018. These new compulsory requirements have led us to study how the previous voluntary practices have been modified and if there is a connection between the auditing and providing assurance company.Design/methodology: The studied sample compiles companies listed on IBEX 35 in 2018 to analyze the first year of application of Law 11/2018, 2018, and the previous one, the year 2017, when this information was voluntarily disclosed. We have created a database with features of non-financial information to carry out a descriptive analysis segmenting the sample by year, cross tables and chi-square tests.Findings: Big Fours are the companies that provide assurance of non-financial information as well as audit the financial information of listed companies. Law 11/2018 has not implied important changes for the IBEX 35 companies because what was compulsorily required at first was previously voluntarily done, i.e. the majority of companies have already applied GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) standards when it was voluntary and also when compulsory and they keep including non-financial information in the management report. It has been also checked that auditing and providing assurance firms are specialized by sectors.Originality/value: Currently there is an intense discussion about the future of non-financial information regulation in Europe. The expected changes will affect the Spanish regulation as a Member State. It is a need to contextualize the starting point.",art
10.3926/ic.2048,"Research trends of the knowledge-based economy: A bibliometric study. Purpose: In recent years, the Knowledge-Based Economy (KBE) has been an emergent field related to Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). In current business models, organizations need to be part of the digital transformation and create value for customers, which has caused an increase in the number of scientific publications on the KBE. This study aims to analyze the research trends of the scientific literature on the KBE published between 1986 and 2021.Design/methodology: A bibliometric analysis was conducted using the Scopus database. The results were analyzed based on quantity, impact, and structure indicators and topics. In addition, this paper proposes a research agenda for future studies in this field.Findings: The study of the KBE has attracted the interest of the scientific community, especially in 2006, 2010, and 2011. This literature review shows that developed countries (e.g., Poland, Romania, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany) have researched this field the most. Terms such as knowledge-based systems, knowledge management, and information management have become more common in the literature and are setting trends. These terms refer to essential components for the advancement of the KBE as an approach that can dynamize the economic development of organizations and countries.Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature because it analyzes the theoretical evolution of the KBE field. In addition, it proposes an agenda for future studies to advance the research fields related to the Triple Helix model of innovation in developing countries",art

10.3926/ic.1700,"Intelligence capital: The management of knowledge assets and development of adaptive capacities in the city of Arequipa. Purpose: The objective of this research is to measure the intelligence components and capabilities in the city of Arequipa, based on the Integral Intelligence Model (Carrillo & Olavarrieta, 2009). This model articulates the notion of Intelligence Capital, which allows components and capabilities to be developed in agents, thus promoting adaptation, knowledge management and quick responses in the optimal decision making by these agents.Design/methodology: The Integral Intelligence Model proposed by Carrillo and Olavarrieta (2009) was taken as a basis, analyzing each of its components and capabilities in relevant agents or organizations in the City of Arequipa. This work identifies how the maturity level of these capabilities makes the operationalization of the Intelligence Capital (IC) possible. The information was obtained through direct interviews with decision-making agents of the institutions in the City of Arequipa (governors and top management of companies in the city), as well as from reports and secondary sources.Findings: This research lays a solid foundation for the proper articulation of the IC as a fundamental element of Knowledge-Based Development (KBD). The results highlight the importance of fine-tuning internal processes for this type of development, the trade-off between the speed of response and good design, execution, development and evaluation of processes and the need to develop intelligence components in organizations, in order to operationalize IC and generate value.Research limitations/implications: The study focuses on the first semester of 2020 in the City of Arequipa, a period characterized by the uncertainty and environmental risk caused by COVID-19.Practical implications: The research reveals that in the City of Arequipa, there are potential intelligence capabilities or components that are consolidated in the design, planning, execution and evaluation of internal and external processes in institutions and organizations. However, the development of these capabilities is diminished by flaws in the identification and processing of information, resulting in only moderately agile responses.Social implications: This research provides evidence that in the KBD model, social agents play a fundamental role in decision-making, as they are the ones who identify and interpret significant events in the environment. This, in turn, allows effective, positive and adaptive responses to be issued that guide and drive the organizations.Originality/value: This study presents a methodology that can be replicated in other cities, and which makes it possible to identify the intelligence capabilities of agents or organizations, in this case of a city.",art
10.3926/ic.2443,"Elevating low-effort engagement to cultivate stronger community commitment: A study of social capital within instagram's brand community. Purpose: This study aimed to analyze the role of social capital in enhancing the engagement of community members, specifically transitioning them from low -effort participation to higher levels of commitment toward the community. Design/methodology: This study presents the results derived from a quantitative analysis of 483 participants across diverse automotive brand communities found on Instagram. Findings: Based on the foundation of social capital theory, this research enquires into the effects of shared relational elements of social capital on the commitment of members to communities. The results indicate that when members perceive an adequate degree of social trust and adhere to a recognized norm of reciprocity, there is a notable influence on the potential for heightened commitment to the community. Research limitations/implications: This study solely focuses on a specific type of social media (Instagram), emphasizing the prominent role of visual presentation style as the primary approach in content creation. In contrast to most previous studies that heavily scrutinize verbal/textual communication presentation platforms regarding online social capital studies, this study has demonstrated that visual presentation communication has a notable impact on the mechanism that triggers positive evaluations among users. Consequently, it significantly incites the development of social trust and reciprocity through social exchange interactions within the community. Originality/value: In visually oriented settings such as Instagram, the barriers to participating in social interactions are noticeably reduced. Consequently, activities requiring minimal engagement are more likely to evolve into more intensified forms of social exchange among members. This condition facilitates the cultivation of social trust and establishing of a norm of reciprocity. This study offers a different perspective regarding the digitally mediated value co -creation. It is not the factor of information quality through comprehensiveness and detail that increases the value perceived by the members, as the textual mode of social media accomplishes. Instead, the affective and emotional appeal in the visually dominant social interaction that significantly generates a sense of closeness and relatedness that eventually improves the perceived value derived from the community. Thus, visual presentation in social exchange is more proficient for relationship building.",art
10.3926/ic.2367,"The mediation effect of firm performance on the association between two-tier independent boards and green innovation practices: Evidence from Indonesia. Purpose: This research examines the role of firm performance in the effect of a two-tier independent board on green innovation practices. Design/methodology/approach: This study employs a simple mediation model -4 using the Hayes Process approach to OLS regression with the R package. The dataset uses a total 518 public companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for 2017 to 2019, having 1,554 firm -year observations. Findings: The study revealed, based on the two-tier system, the role of a composite independent board on firm performance and green innovation is positive and significant. However, individual results for both independent commissaries and directors in terms of firm performance and green innovation practices are not significant. This result implies that a composite of independent boards is essential to reduce and mitigate the failure of corporate governance. Research limitations/implications: This research only applied to a sample of companies from one country adopting a two-tier system. Future research might be conducted as a comparative analysis of countries with a two-tier system as opposed to countries with one -tier system. Practical implications: First, companies need to enhance the knowledge and expertise of both independent directors and independent commissaries to improve their roles. Second, it is important to provide support for the campaign and incentives for green innovation practices. Third, insight drawn from this study leads to the latest regulation from the Financial Services Authority (as the representative of the Indonesian government), whereby independent directors are no longer mandatory for publicly listed companies starting in December 2021 and must be evaluated because the composite independent board is an effective tool to execute green projects and to accelerate the SDG agenda in 2030. Social Implications: The social implication of this study is companies' awareness to produce more eco-based products, which are expected by stakeholders, can be actualized. Also, public perception shows companies with green products have better performance. Originality/value: This research is the first study examining the mediating role of firm performance on the effect of a two-tier independent board on green innovation practices. Second, this study introduces the latest methodology for the simple mediation model using a Hayes -based approach in the field of accounting with an open -source software R package.",art
10.3926/ic.2383,"Personality and leadership style in generation Z: A quantitative study in a higher education institution in Mexico. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to discern the combination of personality traits that most contribute to effective leadership styles in individuals belonging to Generation Z. Design/methodology/approach: We utilized a structural equation model to analyze data from 244 higher education students in Mexico. This approach allowed us to examine the relationship between personality traits, leadership styles, and perceived effectiveness. Findings: Our findings indicate that the transformational leadership style is the most impactful among Generation Z individuals. Furthermore, the personality traits of Openness and Conscientiousness emerged as the most influential in relation to effective leadership styles. Research limitations/implications: Despite valuable insights, limitations exist due to small sample size (n=244) from one institution, restricting generalizability. The cross-sectional nature provides a snapshot, not accounting for societal/technological shifts affecting Generation Z over time. Self -reported data may suffer from biases. The cultural context focuses solely on a Mexican educational setting. Future research calls for larger, more diverse samples across institutions/countries with longitudinal data to offer enhanced, nuanced understanding of evolving leadership and personality traits within Generation Z. Practical implications: Organizations could enhance effectiveness by fostering transformational leadership among Generation Z employees through coaching/training programs tailored for this cohort. Academically, business curricula would benefit from integrating insights on aligning leadership styles with inherent personality traits. Social implications: Transformational leadership emergence within Generation Z may propagate leaders equipped to drive innovation, convey visionary goals, and evoke follower commitment to address pressing societal issues. Originality/value: To our knowledge, this study represents the first investigation within the Mexican context examining the interplay of personality traits, leadership styles, and effectiveness among Generation Z individuals.",art
10.3926/ic.2282,"Sustainability and the environmental impact of the tourism industry: An analysis of the hotel sector in Catalonia, Spain. Purpose: This research examines policies aimed at reducing the environmental impact of the hotel sector in Catalonia, Spain in 2020 and how they are communicated to stakeholders through corporate websites. It applies academic criteria to identify key aspects that are relevant to tourism. Design/methodology/approach: This study conducts a descriptive analysis of Catalonia's hotel sector in 2020, utilizing SABI (Iberian Balance Sheet Analysis System) data. It selects the top 48 companies in the hotel sector that are legally required to report their annual accounts in the regular format. The study then systematically evaluates their websites to assess the availability and transparency of information on environmental sustainability. Findings: Sustainable tourism, marked by non -financial indicators such as environmental impact, energy/water usage and waste generation, is a very important issue for stakeholders in the hotel industry, including governments, owners, investors, and customers. The sector's reporting methods are crucial for effectively communicating environmental policies to these parties. While many companies have implemented strategies to assess and reduce their environmental impact, there is still considerable room for improvement, particularly in communicating these efforts to the various stakeholders. Research limitations/implications: This research, while rigorous, has certain limitations that suggest directions for future studies. A primary constraint involves data reported at a group level by hotel companies, which complicates obtaining specific data for the Catalonia region, particularly for hotel groups with an international presence. Another significant limitation is the reliance on indirect data collection, based on the companies' self -reported environmental policies posted on their websites. Practical implications: By identifying and knowing the environmental policies of the hotel industry over the analyzed period, we can help the industry itself to improve the sustainability of its environmental efforts and make it more attractive to all stakeholders. Social implications: The study highlights the importance of environmental policies and the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the hotel industry. This industry plays an important role in achieving the UN SDGs, which offer significant benefits for business, such as access to new markets, better risk management and long-term sustainability, as well as social benefits. This is increasingly expected by both consumers and investors. Originality/Value: This study examines the commitment and information transparency of the Costa Brava hotel sector in terms of environmental sustainability, as well as its communication strategies. This is achieved primarily through the analysis of corporate websites, comparing the information and indices to those of other entities in the sector. The relevance and value of this analysis stems from the recognition that, despite the efforts made to improve the sector, further progress needs to be made in order to make it more attractive to stakeholders.",art

Purpose: Although university entrepreneurship education as a predictor of entrepreneurial intention (EI) has been verified in the academic literature, few studies have analysed its influence in regions with low entrepreneurial activity. This research provides a new point of view by contrasting students' perceptions with what entrepreneurs consider most relevant. We propose an integrative and multiperspective framework based on expectancy theory and the theory of planned behaviour, which includes the moderating effect of gender and family imprinting.Design/methodology: A valid sample of 108 business students from the University of Huelva (Spain) served as the basis of the study, whose data were analysed using consistent partial least squares (PLSc) to validate the scales and subsequently test the hypotheses. In addition, 54 valid questionnaires from local entrepreneurs were used for the comparative analysis between entrepreneurs and students.Findings: Our findings showed that the elements associated with university support have a significant, albeit negative, impact on students' intentions to become entrepreneurs. In terms of moderating variables, no significant differences were found by gender, but significant differences were found in the group with entrepreneurial parents. In relation to the determinants of entrepreneurial success, it was found that the students' conceptions of entrepreneurship were closer to those of the entrepreneurs in Huelva than to those of the successful entrepreneurs.Originality/value: This paper contributes to the academic debate on whether universities in general, and business schools in particular, should promote entrepreneurship as the core of education. We believe that these results, despite the specific and limited scope of the study, may be of great interest for university staff in regions with high levels of structural unemployment and low rates of total early-stage entrepreneurial activity (TEA) to incorporate into their academic programmes.",art

Purpose: This study provides empirical evidence on the innovations that Nonprofit Organizations (NPOs) in Colombia have implemented within their own management to address social problems which are the object of their institutional mission.Design/methodology: This research is based on information obtained from a survey applied to executives of Colombian NPOs. Multiple linear regression models were developed to check the partial effect of the set of independent variables (Organizational and Social Innovation) over the dependent variable (Organizational Performance). Main Components Analysis was applied to grouping the considered variables.Findings: Empirical evidence indicates that Colombian NPOs are innovative organizations that advisedly follow management strategies for this purpose. Colombian NPOs have been innovating for their disposition to tackle the social problems implicated in their institutional mission. Evidence indicates that the main components derived from NPOs' organizational and social innovations are grouped into four: NPO innovation actions to adapt to the environment; internal innovation actions to improve NPO's performance; variables related with NPO innovation actions to improve their relations with external agents; innovation actions aimed at improving the management of social interventions associated with the mission of the NPOs and the management of institutional projects.Research limitations/implications: The field work only used the survey technique to obtain the information and only assessed the perception of one of the directors of each of the NPOs participating in the study in terms of both the actions of organizational innovation such as social innovation and organizational performance. Therefore, the study undoubtedly presents bias in that perception. The technique used for the selection of the sample of the participants was a non-probabilistic sampling, which implies bias in the information and therefore, limitation for the generalization of the results to other contexts. The geographical location of the administration of the NPOs was restricted to Bogota and surrounding municipalities.Originality/value: An analysis of the relationship between social and organizational innovations with organizational performance in NPOs was carried out in the context of an emerging economy, where the subject has been very little studied and much less with principal component analysis. This in order to contribute to a better understanding of the subject.",art
10.3926/ic.2418,"Managerial perspectives on human resource practice interaction effects and organizational performance in SMEs. Purpose: The aim of this paper is to clarify the human resource management (HRM) literature in small -to -medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by empirically identifying possible combinations of HRM practices from the perspective of managers, and analyzing the relationships among them and with organizational performance in order to identify which combinations are most effective. Design/Methodology/Approach: Using the AMO (Ability- Motivation -Opportunity) framework, we ask whether there are significant interactions between AMO-based HRM bundles and, if so, to what degree and by what means they influence organizational performance. To explore this question, we tested a theoretical model using Partial Least Squares -Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) techniques and compared the interaction and main effects. The research sample comprises SMEs operating in the Basque Region of Spain. Findings: The study confirms the existence of hierarchies among bundles. The practices most strongly related to the SMEs' performance lie in the bundle of motivation -enhancing practices. The results indicate that motivation -enhancing practices have a positive effect on organizational performance and when they are combined with ability -enhancing practices this effect grows. Research limitations/implications: The cross-sectional nature of the data means that it is not possible to establish clear causal relationships among the variables studied. It would therefore be beneficial in the future to use longitudinal designs and examine cause -effect over time, as well as use samples from other geographic locations. Practical Implications: High-performance HRM practices in the three Ability -Motivation -Opportunity (AMO) dimensions should not automatically be assumed to be complementary in an SME context, as many managers believe. Our results suggest that managers would be well advised to adopt motivational practices, combining them with training, to improve SMEs' performance. Originality/value: This is one of the few studies to focus on testing the interaction effects among dimensions of Ability -Motivation -Opportunity -enhancing -practices on SMEs' organizational performance, as observed by managers. It will encourage SME managers to consider more carefully the possible combinations of AMO dimensions and to focus on those combinations most likely to have positive effects.",art
10.3926/ic.2389,"Determinants of innovative behavior from the perspective of individual factors: A conceptual framework. Purpose: This study outlines the structured dimensions of innovative work behavior (IWB). It interprets and associates the underlying characteristics found in the existing literature to develop a conceptual framework, which provides a comprehensive overview of IWB from the perspective of individual factors. This study also identifies the cognitive and behavioral determinants of individual innovative behavior and the most related management theories. Furthermore, it investigates the quantitative modeling methods used to explore this phenomenon and recommends practical managerial applications to promote employees' innovative behavior. Design/methodology/approach: The conceptual framework was developed through a systematic literature review, following three fundamental stages: 1) planning, 2) development, and 3) synthesis of the review. We retrieved 637 documents, spanning a 5-year time frame, from both Scopus and Web of Science academic information indexing and retrieval systems. Subsequently, seven inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to determine the eligibility of the studies, incorporating the guidelines from the PRISMA statement. The final sample consisted of 49 scientific articles that answered five guiding questions, leading to the integration of the framework. Findings: This study examines the dimensions of IWB-that is, the generation, introduction, and realization of ideas-by analyzing the fundamental properties mentioned by the authors of the selected documentary sample. It further identifies 48 determinants of IWB, categorized under three organizational management theories: personality traits, self-determination, and social exchange theories. This study also analyzes the applied quantitative research methods, business sectors, and countries investigated, identifying the most commonly used methods and most frequently investigated sectors and countries. Additionally, it highlights the current research agenda for promoting IWB as an enabler of competitive organizational development. Finally, we present a conceptual framework that provides a theoretical structure for understanding individual IWB. Practical implications: We clarify the current research landscape of IWB in an organizational context. We also help identify the level of academic interest in this subject for future studies. Furthermore, we compile valuable recommendations for business managers aiming to enhance the competencies of their workforce in managing innovative processes. Originality/value: We introduce a new conceptual framework for IWB that considers its primary strategic purposes. Therefore, this study is a reference point for future empirical innovation management studies. It provides a classification of individual-level determinants with a cognitive and behavioral focus, incorporating constructs such as spirituality, altruism, ethical and empathic behaviors, and resilience.",art
10.3926/ic.2213,"Analysis of determinants influencing the level of intellectual capital disclosure: The case of FTSE 100 entities. Purpose: The paper deals with the issue of intellectual capital (IC) and its disclosure in the financial statements and other parts of annual reports of FTSE 100 entities. The paper aims to identify the determinants that influence entities to reveal IC related information and to highlight the theoretical aspects behind such determinants, resulting in comprehensive findings. The results of the analysis can be used to understand what leads entities to make decisions in the field of non-financial disclosure and help in the development of the IC reporting framework.Design/methodology: The research is devoted to the analysis of the relationship between the level of IC disclosures by companies and the analysed determinants - size, asset structure, profitability, industry and the factor of time. The dataset can be characterised as a panel data set containing 100 firms from the FTSE100 Index for the four most recent financial years (2018-2021). To produce a comprehensive set of results, descriptive statistics are used, followed by regression and correlation analysis. The random effect method is used as it has a higher predictive power than pooled OLS and fixed effect methods in analysing panel data. Findings: Based on the results of the analysis, it was concluded that the profitability measured as ROA is not a key factor of intellectual capital disclosure in the annual reports of FTSE 100 companies. From the point of view of size, there exists a statistically significant relationship between total assets and all components of IC, respectively overall IC. The analysis also showed a statistically significant impact of the sector in which companies operate. Particularly, companies in the service sector report more information on human capital and companies in the high-tech sector report more information on structural capital. A significant effect of asset structure was found for structural capital but only taking into account the effect of goodwill, not through the effect of other intangible assets. Finally, the paper demonstrated a positive and significant effect of the time factor on the level of reporting of all IC components.Originality/value: This paper focuses on the determinants influencing the level of IC reporting in a representative sample of entities from the highly active FTSE100 Index, which provides a very recent and specific data sample from a research perspective. The paper is based on determinants that are frequently reported in existing research, and it extends the scope by incorporating the effect of intangible assets and goodwill as variables representing the asset structure in addition to the effect of time. This paper presents statistically based results on the relationships between the determinants and IC but also between the different elements of IC (human capital, structural capital and relational capital), which provide insights into the structure of reported information on intellectual capital. This insight is very substantial given that many studies ignore the characteristics of the different components of the IC as they may be affected by different determinants.",art
10.3926/ic.1368,"Employability and professional success: A study about the economy and business graduates. Purpose: The aim of this paper is to reach a conclusion about the aspects that enable graduates to achieve success in the labour market. The analysis focuses on the factors that accelerate graduates' entry into the labour market as well as those that foster their success 2 years after graduation, when it is considered that their career is in the first phase of consolidation.Design/methodology: Our analysis was conducted among graduates in Economics and Business in Catalonia. The data were collected from the Agencia Catalana per a la Qualitat Universitaria (AQU) survey that was carried out in 2014; the results were published in 2017. ANOVA analysis was performed.Findings: Our results show that university grades and the influence that studying in a specific university are not important in relation to the length of time needed to enter the labour market. Nevertheless, socio-economic variables and previous experience in the labour market play important roles. Our analysis focuses on professional success 2 years after graduation, concluding that the factors related graduates academic (university grades and type of university) and socio-economic backgrounds play a decisive role. The academic background and the labour situation are very important to guarantee professional success. Precarious job conditions pose an obstacle to professional advancement. The relationship with work experience during the undergraduate period is not clear.Originality/value: The study sheds some light on the variables affecting the success of professional life both when graduates access the labour market and 2 years later. Until now, the studies analysing the Spanish situation have focused on isolated factors, but no studies have analysed employability and professional success as a whole. We obtain a complete picture of the variables that increase employability, providing a reference for universities and politicians when defining their strategies.",art

Purpose: To analyse the scientific production around public R&D&I funds in Spain, in a context in which policies to promote innovation and development are considered essential for the progress of developed countries and receive significant amounts of the public budget.Design/methodology: Systematic review of all the scientific contributions collected in the Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus and Proquest until March 2021, in which mention is made of R&D&I grants in Spain.Findings: Scientific production indicates the positive impact of R&D&I aid on employment, private investment and cooperation. The list of topics which academic research deals with in this sense is, however, limited. Thus, aspects are identified in which there is still not enough scientific evidence, such as the effect of aid on the production of patents and utility models or the dissemination of the supported projects.Research limitations/implications: The analysed data is limited to the Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus and Proquest. Gray literature is not analysed.Originality/value: It is a study that can be useful to define future support policies for R&D&I aimed at companies.",art
10.3926/ic.1734,"Psychosocial factors and risks in work environments: Case study of employees of MSMES in Medellin- Colombia. Purpose: The purpose of this research is to determine which are the elements associated with work environments that generate psychosocial risks in employees. The empirical application considers the case of companies located in the city of Medellin. Design/methodology: Exploratory, qualitative research based on the review of literature in documentary sources on psychosocial risk factors and dimensions using the evaluation tool SUSESO/ISTAS21 Questionnaire short version. The data collected are grouped into dimensions and sub-dimensions and then described by means of factor analysis. Findings: The most relevant findings in relation to general health, mental health, vitality and stress symptoms of workers could be caused by factors such as excessive workload. These factors correspond to psychosocial risks: psychological, cognitive and sensory demands are due to lack of skills and training. Active work and skill development can lead to mechanisation, incompetence and lack of creativity. In the social support dimension lack of direction leads to lack of responsibilities and procedures. In the compensation dimension, risks associated with salary conditions and retention policies are affected, and in the dual presence dimension, risks are consolidated by increased demands and incompatible demands on working time. Originality/value: Through this research, it was possible to identify psychosocial risk factors that may affect psychological health, which reveals a wide field of knowledge for future research.",art
10.3926/ic.1870,"Vocational continuing training in Spain: Contribution to the challenge of Industry 4.0 and structural unemployment. Purpose: To diagnose the situation of vocational continuing training in Spain and propose improvements to its management to reduce the structural unemployment rate, taking into account the effects of Industry 4.0 and COVID-19. Design/methodology: Study of the background and current context of vocational continuing training and Industry 4.0 in Spain based on a review of previous academic literature, legislative developments in education and training, and various reports from public and private institutions on productivity and employment. Findings: Definition of eight challenges and lines of action related to completing the implementation of Industry 4.0 and adopting coordinated policies to develop VCT, improving the governance of the FCP by the public administration, promoting training in work and vocational training and guidance for the unemployed, meeting business recruitment needs, promoting business-university relationships, and reducing unemployment. Practical implications: Adapting vocational continuing training to economic sectors where there is more demand for employment and to regions where there is more structural unemployment can contribute to the overall reduction of structural unemployment in Spain. These decreases could have immediate consequences for those who become employed and allow a quicker recovery in future economic crises. Originality/value: This study, despite the scarce empirical evidence that exists about Spanish vocational continuing training, provides a vision of the four areas in which it is developed professional training, postgraduate training, on-the-job training, and training for the unemployed to provide thirty proposals that, through education and training, promote the competitiveness of the Spanish economy and permanent employment.",art
10.3926/ic.1685,"Student commitment to social responsibility: Systematic literature review, conceptual model, and instrument. Purpose: This study aims to carry out a systematic literature review on empirical manifestations of the student commitment to social responsibility in order to propose a conceptual model that systematizes the underlying patterns in these manifestations and an instrument that makes it measurable.Design/methodology: Four macro-processes were deployed: identify (locate the relevant literary space; the initial sample comprised 52 studies which later resulted in a sample of 24 studies), describe (narrative synthesis of the studies), deepen (grouping patterns, validation, and characterization of the relevant literary space), and disseminate (preparation/refinement of the report).Findings: This work provides a conceptual model comprising six dimensions about student commitment to social responsibility as well as a validated instrument at the content level that makes these dimensions empirically observable/measurable.Practical implications: Insights are provided to focus efforts and organizational resources to develop the commitment addressed.Originality/value: The proposed model and instrument provide greater clarity and homologation on the conception, composition, and empirical manifestations of the student commitment to social responsibility and its future measurement.",art

10.3926/ic.2093,"A service-learning program assessment: Strengths, weaknesses and impacts on students. Purpose: This paper aims to research the strengths and weaknesses of service-learning programs in order to identify the challenges of their application, the educational possibilities of service-learning and the impact on students.Design/methodology: An observational case study model was used, through a qualitative research approach based on participant observation. Additional data collection tools were used before and after the service-learning methodology; these included personal interviews, field diaries and videos. Data analysis was performed using Atlas.ti7 qualitative software.Findings: This paper shows the relevant educational possibilities of service-learning. Students have the potential to take action in response to social problems, using the professional skills they have learned in their degree program, encouraging their critical awareness through reflection processes and promoting their involvement as citizens engaged in their own reality. This work reveals both the strengths and weaknesses of service-learning programs, including the needs assessment, project-based learning, and partnership engagement, all of which are outlined as challenges in terms of their application.Research limitations/implications: The findings of this qualitative paper pertain to one single case, but they are generalizable to related theories.Practical implications: This research could be used to a guide to begin or improve service-learning projects in higher education. Social implications: The findings on the social impact of service-learning for all the agents involved show the positive value of service-learning. Moreover, it shows service-learning is an efficient tool to introduce sustainability and the SDGs in the students' curriculum.Originality/value: This research reveals the importance of the promotion and evaluation of service -learning in an area where little research has been done in this regard.",art
10.3926/ic.2079,"Immigrant entrepreneurship and gender dimensions: A systematic review. Purpose: This paper discusses whether the gender dimension of immigrants influences their entrepreneurial activities in host societies. Human capital theory, social capital theory, and disadvantage theory are used to explore immigrant entrepreneurship and its understanding as a migration research field worthy of more attention. Design/methodology: A systematic review of the literature is used, selecting articles from Scopus, Jstor, Elsevier, Research, Web of Science, Google Scholar databases, Taylor & Francis Online and Google's search engine. The studies obtained between 2000 and 2021 were screened, and only those measuring the entrepreneurial spirit of immigrants on the basis of gender were included in the final data set. The revision of the selected paper provides deductive perspectives on a common trend in immigrant entrepreneurship from a gender perspective. Findings: Out of 200 studies, only 20 fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Throughout these 20 studies, it was found that female immigrant entrepreneurs face many challenges in sustaining their businesses based on human capital, social capital, and disadvantage perspectives, as well as obtaining family support for their business activities. In some host societies, immigrant women entrepreneurs face discrimination not only because of gender but also because of discrimination on the basis of race. The dominance of male migrants in the host societies continues. Social implications: Female immigrant entrepreneurs face more difficulties than male immigrants in terms of human capital skills and possessing sufficient social capital skills to create an enterprise. Therefore, the study implies that destination countries(which are defined as those countries receiving immigrants and offering them domocile) should have start-up visa programs, specialized business incubator and accelerator programs, outreach and incentive programs, and other governmental strategies used to draw high-potential immigrant entrepreneurs. Originality/value: In this study, we specifically consider female immigrant enterprises to be as important as male enterprises in supporting the social and economic integration of immigrants. On the other hand, this study also shows the disadvantages female immigrant entrepreneurs face before and after establishing a business and starting their entrepreneurial activities.",art

Purpose: The objective of this study is to determine whether sustainability practices of business schools improve the internationalization of the institution and its notoriety and thereby increase student satisfaction.Design/methodology: The sample considered in this study consisted of 272 Spanish business school graduates. The data was collected via an online survey during the first quarter of 2020. To validate the hypotheses and the model, structural equation modelling was carried out using a robust method.Findings: Business schools' commitment to sustainability not only has an ethical component but also improves their positioning, leading to a greater competitive advantage.Practical implications: The results obtained point to sustainability practices facilitating entry processes involving joint agreements among business schools and leading to accreditation and/or sustainability policies.Originality/value: This study examines external variables which have rarely been tested and are considered as being highly relevant to achieving high satisfaction among business school graduates.",art
10.3926/ic.2011,"Predicting procrastination with academic performance: Towards the anticipation of a higher education problem. Purpose: With the purpose of predicting the problem of procrastination, we study how age, sex, type of studies and grade for admission to higher education influence the procrastination behavior of students.Design/methodology: In a sample of 359 university students, the Pure Procrastination scale was applied, as well as data on sex, age, grade previous to join the university, grade completed and year of study (first to fourth). To identify underlying variables or factors that explain the configuration of correlations in the items of the scale used, an exploratory factor analysis was carried out (principal component analysis with Varimax normalization). Next, a multiple linear regression analysis was performed with the variables sex, age, and admission grade as independent variables and academic procrastination as the dependent variable.Findings: It has been possible to identify the variables that influence the procrastinating behavior of university students. From the identification of which students will possibly present procrastinating behaviors, the people responsible for university education will be able to implement intervention programs to deal with procrastination.Research limitations/implications: The sample is not representative of the universe of university students, although the results obtained are relevant enough to replicate the study in other university contexts. Our data could have included more instruments for collecting information, which in future studies would entail incorporating scales related to the perception of time management, motivation or self-regulation.Practical implications: Distinguishing, among university students, those who may present more procrastination tendencies will guide those responsible for the educational process of said students with respect to measures to alleviate the negative effects of procrastination through psycho-socio-educational intervention programs.Social implications: The knowledge derived from this work has practical implications for the students themselves who, in the case of being identified as a potential procrastinator, may benefit from a psycho-socio-educational intervention that will help them manage their time and reduce the discomfort derived from the procrastination.Originality/value: On the previous corpus of existing scientific knowledge, this work provides knowledge that allows optimizing, both at a public and private level, the academic, economic and social resources of university institutions in which procrastination can affect the preparation and the student performance.",art
10.3926/ic.2110,"The role of asynchronous and synchronous activities in university academic performance: A comparative study of traditional and inverted class methodologies. Purpose: The objective of this work is to investigate the effect of synchronous and asynchronous activities on the academic performance of university students. For this purpose, the academic results obtained and the involvement and motivation of the student and the teacher in the different learning methodologies involved are analyzed. Students' perception of the effectiveness of the flipped class with the face-to-face classroom and online methodologies is compared to that of the traditional learning methodology. Design/methodology: Data were collected from undergraduate students in three marketing courses and were analyzed through a quantitative descriptive, quasi-experimental and cross-sectional study. Academic performance with the different learning methodologies and the effect of synchronous and asynchronous activities on academic performance were compared using logistic regression on each course and methodology.Findings: The results showed that academic performance in synchronous and asynchronous activities was better in the flipped class, except for synchronous activities in the online flipped class. In addition, the best academic performance was obtained in the face-to-face inverted classes. The explanatory effect of asynchronous activities on academic performance was also identified. The greatest predictive capacity and the best prognosis were obtained in the online inverted classes. Students expect to obtain satisfactory results with the inverted class methodology and perceive it as effective, although they prefer a mixture of inverted classes and the traditional methodology.Originality/value: We contribute to theoretical and practical research with this new model to study the influence of the flipped learning methodology and asynchronous and synchronous activities on academic performance. We believe that these results, despite the specific and limited scope of the study, will be of great interest to the teaching community and contribute to improving the motivation and performance of students, which constitutes a main challenge in the higher education system.",art
10.3926/ic.2180,"Research trends in the field of organisational management: A bibliometric analysis. Purpose: Studies into organisational management are considered key to understanding the characteristics of the organisational fabric in general, and administrative managers' capacity for reflection is particularly relevant to achieving a more intricate and in-depth comprehension of the organisational context. Nonetheless, despite the importance of such studies, there is a lack of alignment in the specialised literature and no review articles that allow us to identify research trends in the field. The purpose of this paper is, thus, to identify the main research trends in the literature on organisational management.Design/methodology: We conducted a bibliometric analysis with 457 articles following the PRISMA Statement guidelines, which is why we specified the inclusion and exclusion criteria, data sources, search strategy, and the data collection and selection processes we employed.Findings: The increasingly growing amount of research done on the topic is evidence of its significance. Using quality and quantity indicators, we were able to identify the most productive authors, journals, and countries in the field. Also, by means of a keyword analysis, we identified the most relevant research trends and classified them per year. According to the results of such analysis, organisational performance and organisational culture are currently the most influential topics, and themes related to transformational leadership are likely to be increasingly used in future research.Originality/value: This study identifies the concepts that have been most prominent and that are outlined as crucial for the research agenda or future work in the field, which would allow organisations to be aligned with the Industry 4.0 trends.",art
10.3926/ic.2046,"Wellbeing of female employees: What workplaces attract women?. Purpose: Previous research has highlighted that employee wellbeing in the workplace is closely linked to equity, achievement, and interactions. However, gender inequality in employment opportunities, work-life imbalance, the gender pay gap, and the existence of the glass ceiling are workplace realities and generate failures that can reduce women's wellbeing. Based on the theories of organisational justice, affective events, and transactional stress, this research attempts to identify the initiatives or actions that can act as true levers to promote equality and to contribute to the creation of inclusive and attractive workplaces for female employees.Design/methodology: This study was carried out using the Delphi method. The panel consisted of a group of Spanish experts from the academic and professional fields who had close relationships with the topic of research.Findings: Parity objectives and flexibility measures are actions that can be effective in achieving gender equality in companies. Factors related to equitable, fair, and non-discriminatory treatment are the main determinants of female wellbeing in the workplace. The quality of female employment and having leaders capable of creating inclusive environments increases the attractiveness of organisations for women.Originality/value: This research yields interesting findings on the responsibility and role of companies in fulfilling the demands of female employees and in making women fall in love with the workplace.",art
10.3926/ic.1626,"Study of emotional skills in a sample of students and workers. Purpose: The aim of this study is to assess the levels of emotional intelligence (EI) and emotional competencies according to gender in a sample comprising working adults and of undergraduate college students and to analyze gender divergence from the distinct angles of EI and emotional competencies.Design/methodology: T-test analysis is applied to determine the differences between scores for men and women in each of the sub-samples. Self-report instruments were administered to determine the levels of EI and emotional competencies in a sample of 102 working adults from different companies in Latin America, and 378 college undergraduate students from San Francisco de Quito University in Ecuador. The evaluation of EI was measured using the short version of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue-SF) in Spanish, as developed by Perez (2003) and the evaluation of self -regulation competencies was measured using Measurement of Affective Regulation Styles - MARS (Paez et al., 2014).Findings: First, detailed analysis of the variables for the working adult's sample showed that the highest score belongs to the total measurement of affective regulation styles (MARS) scale. Second, in connection with the different facets of TEIQue-SF, the highest was emotionality (43.245), while the lower score was related to adaptability (11.362). Analysis of the working adult's sample by gender showed no compelling discrepancy between males and females in terms of emotional competencies and EI. However, it is worth noting that men showed slightly higher scores for adaptability than women. Results for the students' sample showed that the self-control appears to be higher in men than in women, suggesting that men show a model of greater emotional control than women who participated in the study. This finding contrasts with the competencies and skills evaluated with the MARS instrument, which reported women achieving higher scores than men.Originality/value: This study contributes to research on EI traits and EI competencies as well as attempting to close a gap in the literature regarding this topic from a gender perspective. The analysis sheds additional light on the topic by addressing the differences in EI traits and competencies between male and female working adults and university students. Finally, this study contributes to the research on the impact of EI in the workplace and in academic environments.",art
10.3926/ic.2456,"Business sustainability practices and financial performance in the creative economy sector in Indonesia: Moderating role of power distance and long-term orientation. Purpose: This research explores the effect of business sustainability practices (BSP) on micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) financial performance, with cultural dimensions serving as moderating variables. Design/methodology/approach: A survey strategy was used to gather data from 467 MSMEs keris respondents in Indonesia. Meanwhile, the hypothesis was validated using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) method. Findings: The results suggested that incorporating BSP positively impacted financial performance. This research also reported the moderating effects of culture on the relationship between BSP and financial performance. However, there was no evidence to support the idea that long-term orientation (LtO) in BSP moderated financial performance. Research limitations/implications: This research should be carried out in other sectors to observe the differences in characteristics of each MSMEs location. Additionally, cultural dimensions were considered to obtain more complex results. Theoretical implication: BSP enhanced MSMEs financial performance, particularly when cultural factors such as power distance (PwD) were considered. Managerial implication: The results implied that MSMEs systematically integrated BSP into business strategies and operations. Meanwhile, cultural factors, such as PwD could be reported in the implementation of these practices to optimize financial performance. Originality/value: Novel insights were provided into the effect of BSP on MSMEs financial performance, emphasizing the role of cultural factors. This research advanced the literature by showing the moderating influence of the cultural context on practices and identified a gap regarding LtO.",art
10.3926/ic.2107,"Towards an integrated definition of job crafting. Purpose: The aim of this paper is to form a comprehensive definition to describe the term job crafting.Design/methodology: A qualitative and quantitative analysis of the CSR communication variables of corporate websites was carried out to identify the companies with the best CSR web communication practices, and an economic and financial comparative analysis was undertaken.Findings: In this research paper on the term job crafting, 76 different definitions of its meaning were identified. After a systematic analysis of these definitions, with the aim of extracting the common elements that characterise job crafting, a definition is proposed, which makes it possible to include any typology, based on three key elements: the employee's proactivity, the impact on the environment and the context in which the activity is carried out.Research limitations/implications: The analysis is based on a review of extant literature, which previously has not considered the impact of such definitions of job crafting on hybrid (physical and remote) and virtual (metaverse) environments. Practical implications: The paper aims to provide a simple and all-inclusive definition of job crafting that serves as a basis for identifying attitudes and behavior that will help in talent attraction, selection and development processes.Social implications: This integrated definition will help individuals to develop the attitudes and behavior which will enable them to adapt their professional activities in a context where, according to the World Economic Forum (2020 study), 50% of the jobs we know today will disappear by 2030.Originality/value: This article attempts to provide a succinct and all-inclusive definition of the term job crafting; something which has not previously been achieved.",art
10.3926/ic.1833,"Oil and its influence on the creation of a sustainable society: A systematic literature review. Purpose: The aim of this work is to analyze the petroleum industry from the perspective of sustainability, taking into account its three dimensions: economic, environmental and social. Likewise, the objective is to identify and propose factors of sustainability, in other words, categories or subdivisions that allow us to analyze in greater detail the interactions and the effects of this industry on society, which must be evaluated in each of the three dimensions for the oil sector.Design/methodology: This research was carried out by means of a systematic review of the literature, with a qualitative focus of an analytic/interpretive nature. A four-phase protocol was used for the search, using the guidelines of the PRISMA statement as a reference. This protocol describes the article selection criteria, search strategy, data extraction and procedures and tools used for the analysis.Findings: The review reveals the need to establish a consensus on the sustainability factors that must be evaluated in each of the dimensions within the oil sector, given that the results of the search show that there is no clear definition or correlation with regard to the environmental, social and economic impact in the oil-producing regions. Most of the works identified were designed as case studies and a large majority of the results of the studies are contradictory, even showing adverse effects, while others fail to identify any hazards.Originality/value: The most relevant contribution of this work is related to the identification of specific sustainability factors for the oil industry, which make it possible to conduct a comprehensive analysis of their influence on the three dimensions of sustainability, namely economic development, environmental aspects and social aspects. This classification according to factors is important in order to provide a cross-cutting conceptual framework that is applicable to any region or situation where the problems are being analyzed that derive from oil exploitation.",art
10.3926/ic.2028,"An experimental research on emotional stimuli of consumers: The case of H&M flagship store influence on the millennial customer experience in Barcelona. Purpose: The main objective of this exploratory research study was to demonstrate the extent to which customers' approach-avoidance responses to fast fashion flagship stores can be predicted from their emotional states framed according to the PAD (Pleasure, Arousal, and Dominance) model and information rates.Design/methodology: Data was collected through a survey questionnaire from 72randomly selected millennials visiting H&M flagship store, just after their visit (55% women and 45% men). Data was analysed using exploratory factor analysis to classify the measures and later through regression analysis explaining the predictor variables.Findings: In accordance with the theory and past research on PAD measures, results show PAD as a highly predictable variable over most of the approach-avoidance behaviour in a flagship store environment. Pleasure variable shows highly significant relationship with affect, approach-avoidance (average of all measures of approach-avoidance), and time spent in the store and to an extent significantly relates to purchase intentions. This signifies that in a highly pleasant environment, an individual's affectionate behaviour, to remain exploring in the store for a longer time, and on an average the approach behaviour to the flagship store will be highly positive. Originality/value: This study is a unique exploration, as very little is known in the literature, on flagship store influences over consumer experiences. Findings suggest interesting advancement in the field of in person shopping effects and encourages future research in flagship store economic investments and marketing impacts, which may extend consumer behavioural scopes as well. This exploratory research may have implications of interest for business strategic decision, brand management, and for marketing as well. As brands seek to recover consumers in their physical stores, offering them a safer and more complete shopping experience, flagship stores can play a key role in encouraging online customers' visiting stores in-person, which may ultimately increase sales.",art

Purpose: This paper analyses the effect on economic profitability of the adoption of work-life balance practices. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of Spanish listed companies during the period 2015-2022, the aim was to contrast the effect of a work-life balance index on economic profitability. Findings: The regression analysis, clustered at firm level, shows a positive and significant effect of the index on economic profitability, suggesting that companies' practices to achieve a work-life balance could be a source of competitive advantage increasing human capital. Originality/value: Firstly, investigating the consequences of work-life balance practices at company level rather than at individual level, and secondly, running a longitudinal study as opposed to cross-sectional studies, which are more frequent in the literature. Thirdly, adding evidence from a continental European country, Spain, as opposed to previous studies carried out mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries as well as considering the work-life balances currently used by listed firms in the Spanish market. Finally, this relationship is analysed over a time-period that considers a health crisis such as COVID-19, which had a major impact on business and labour dynamics.",art
10.3926/ic.2090,"Proptech: A qualitative analysis of online real estate brokerage agencies in Spain. Purpose: The arrival of new companies that are more technological and scalable to the real estate sector has caused a revolution in a very conservative and not very innovative industry. The main objective of this research is to characterize the business model of proptech online brokerage companies in home sales in Spain, based on the traditional agency model.Design/methodology: Nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with the CEOs and managers of six proptech online real estate brokerage agencies in Spain. Their content was analyzed by means of the study and comparison of common patterns.Findings: During the digitalization process of the brokerage, a regression was detected back to more classic procedures typically found in traditional agencies, thus establishing an important difference as compared to other more transparent markets. Accordingly, a convergence occurs between the different real estate brokerage models (online and traditional), resulting in a hybrid model.Research limitations/implications: The limited number of agencies that operate in the online mode in Spain makes the sample size quite small.Practical implications: The results contribute greater transparency to a traditional sector characterized by its opacity, and they give visibility to the changes that are currently taking place, facilitating information to both professionals and users.Social implications: It contributes to the fulfillment of sustainable development goal number 9, concerning the promotion of development-oriented policies that support the creation of decent jobs, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation.Originality/value: It expands the scientific literature dedicated to online real estate brokerage in Spain, given that as of today, we have no knowledge of any other published academic work on this topic. The research contributes to the vision that new sector agents have of it and those changes that are occurring within it.",art

Purpose: The aim of this research is to analyze the academic literature on online grocery shopping to identify a set of variables to assess by means of a validated survey the shopping habits of the population of Catalonia, starting from COVID-19, in a representative sample of the population in the 2020-2021 pandemic period. Design/methodology: The methodology used for this research is qualitative and quantitative, since a validated survey is carried out with a representative sample of the population of Catalonia and subsequently, using a quantitative methodology, the answers of the questionnaire are analyzed using descriptive statistics to interpret the results and reach conclusions. Findings: More people are planning to shop online in the future because of COVID-19 than not people who have shopped online for the first time during the pandemic. Users who have increased their online grocery shopping during the pandemic also intend to use online grocery shopping in the future. Because of COVID-19, the adoption of online grocery shopping has advanced by a few years. However, it must be taken into account that the consumer still perceives risks, such as the fact that many people want to see fresh products before buying them. Originality/value: The most relevant contribution of this work is related to show how online food shopping is for customers and to value the shopping experience in times of pandemic. Thus, the results are intended to contribute to assess online grocery shopping and to detect the customer's perception of this type of shopping.",art

10.3926/ic.1318,"Counterproductive work behavior, job stress, trait emotional intelligence and person organization fit among employees of leasing industry in Indonesia. Purpose: This study aims at comprehending the effect of stress on counterproductive work behavior. As job stress is an individual attitude, trait emotional intelligence (EI) was considered the determinant factor. In addition, the effect of person-organization (PO) fit was also scrutinized as a predictor of job stress.Design/methodology: The study used quantitative surveys in the leasing industry of Indonesia. 88 valid responses were used in the analysis. The analysis was conducted using Structural Equation Modelling with the help of the Smart PLS. The variables were measured using robust indicators from previous studies.Findings: The results confirmed three meaningful relationships between counterproductive work behavior, job stress, trait EI and PO fit. Specifically, the analysis found a negative association between trait EI and job stress. It also revealed the negative effect of PO fit on job stress. However, the study failed to provide empirical evidence to support the relationship between job stress and counterproductive work behavior.Research limitations/implications: This study has low generalization power since it did not construct from large sample size. Future research efforts should consider adding alternative dimensions that could help to better understand and predict CWB.Practical and social implications: This study provides guidelines for practitioner to select and promote high EI candidates since they are proven to be less susceptible to stress. This study also suggests companies to align working atmosphere with employees' characteristics. It also contributes to social interaction in the workplace by pointing companies to establish less stressfully work atmosphere.Originality/value: This study considers alternative procedures to measuring counterproductive work behavior compared to those used in previous studies. Additionally, this study includes both personal or individual characteristics and interaction between the person and the organization to predict job stress.",art
10.3926/ic.1775,"Engaging with untruthful company crisis communication: The understanding of decoupling in the face of crisis. Purpose: By considering the organizational legitimacy framework, this work examines how offending companies decouple their narratives from the facts as a communication strategy when handling environmental crises in the Latin American context. It also considers the implications of such behavior in terms of its potential inconsistency with the organizational value system, and therefore with the ethical sense of the crisis communication practice.Design/methodology: The research relies on a multi-case study approach, where four major environmental incidents involving four extractive companies in Venezuela, Colombia, Mexico, and Argentina are analyzed. By scrutinizing public sources, these companies' crisis communication processes are examined to allow for the linking of theory and practice.Findings: Results obtained suggest that to defend their legitimacy, companies deliberately conveyed untruthful messages and decouple their communication in crisis from reality, which in turn exposes a delinking between values and actions, resulting in ethical concerns for the practice of both crisis management and crisis communication. This work identifies four different decoupling-based crisis communication strategies performed by companies and the way these are accompanied by secondary strategies.Research limitations/implications: By emphasizing the connection between legitimacy and crisis communication, the study illustrates how narrative-fact decoupling (i.e., untruthful crisis communication practices) can be an indicative of more profound organizational contradictions. However, due to the constraints of case studies, it is acknowledged that the results obtained have boundaries for generalization.Originality/value: Instead of approaching decoupling as a trigger for crisis, the present investigation considers decoupling as a communicational strategy some companies engage with, when handling crisis. Furthermore, by focusing on Latin America, the study reflects the potential impact that the geographical context may have on the bodies of knowledge of organizational crisis communication and legitimacy.",art
10.3926/ic.2100,"Importance of sustainable training for the employment of the future. Purpose: University learning of a group of competencies, also proposed by Bologna, is currently gaining importance: transversal competencies, already included in the OECD Competencies Report (2019) which, common to all university degrees, bring the student closer to a new reality and to a diverse professional future, where sustainable leaders will be one of the fundamental axes of any decision.Design/methodology: The results of a massive survey that was carried out on how university students perceive and value these skills are analyzed, together with a series of qualitative interviews with employers, analyzing what deficiencies exist.Findings: The results show that soft skills are essential for the professional future of students and that they understand and value it. Likewise, it was observed that it is essential to establish a common system of certified recognition of these competences and that universities must develop instruments that facilitate their accreditation in the workplace through digital badgesPractical implications: For its effective development, it is necessary to incorporate in the different degree studies a type of training anchored in the values and attitudes necessary to achieve a fairer and more balanced society, in line with what the Sustainable Development Goals 3, 4 and 8 mark.Originality/value: This study provides a vision of the need for training in certain skills to achieve a rapprochement between the labor market and the university.",art
10.3926/ic.1781,"The impact of employee empowerment on organisational performance: The mediating role of employee engagement and organisational citizenship behaviour. Purpose: This study assesses the mediating role of employee engagement and organisational citizenship behaviour in the relationship between employee empowerment (structural, psychological) and organisational performance in non-commercial banks in Ghana.Design/methodology: A structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to test the proposed hypothesis based on 304 employees selected from eight non-commercial banks in the Bono Region, Ghana.Findings: Neither structural nor psychological empowerment are a direct contributor to organisational performance but they positively influence organisational citizenship behaviour and employee engagement. Employee engagement and organisational citizenship behaviour show no effect on organisational performance. Organisational citizenship behaviour was also found to be a significant mediator in the relationship between employee empowerment (structural and psychological) and organisational performance but employee engagement is not a significant mediator.Practical implications: The study offers managers information to help deal with absenteeism, increase employee psychological health, promote better home life, improve employee retention and increase job satisfaction. Practitioners are offered insights to help involve their employees in decision-making and offer them the freedom to act on their own. Finally, practically, the results reveal the need to retain employees who have organisational citizenship behaviour to improve performance.Originality/value: The study serves two purposes: as a confirmatory and as a hypothesised model. The confirmatory model entails goodness of fit and chi-square test. The hypothesised model relies on examining the interactions among structural and psychological empowerment, organisational citizenship behaviour, employee engagement and organisational performance in a developing economy.",art

Purpose: The first objective of this study is to analyze the presence of women boards of commissioners (WBoC) and firm performance (FP). Subsequently, the second objective is to analyze the role of family ownership (FO) in strengthening the influence of WBoC on FP. Design/methodology/approach: This study used secondary data with a sample of all companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2017 to 2021. Accordingly, a total of 788 observations were employed and data were analyzed using moderate regression analysis with unbalanced panel data. Findings: The results revealed that WBoC had no effect on FP as measured by TQ and ROA. Empirical research has also shown that FO strengthens WBoC in increasing ROA and TQ. Research limitations/implications: In Indonesia, the portion of the representation of each company's women board of commissioners involves only one member at an average of 78%. Besides, as many as 22% of companies with a board of commissioners have more or equal to 2 members. Practical implications: The findings serve as a guide for stockholders in choosing capable women board of commissioners for an effective supervisory system that drives the success of businesses. Originality/value: This study brings forth FO as a moderating variable in the influence of WBoC on FP by adopting a multi-theoretical framework (agency theory, resource dependence theory (RDT), and socioemotional welfare theory (SEW)), which helps explain the various reasons that determine FP.",art
10.3926/ic.1745,"Business organizations as living beings. Purpose: The objective of the work is to assess whether the Organic Model is a management model that positively impacts the environment of organizations and facilitates their survival. This model considers that all organisms actively integrated by human beings, become their own entities that maintain a similar structure as a reflection of these. The holistic vision of the human being and, consequently, of the organizations, from which the Organic Model starts, provides the management of the company with a greater awareness of the impact of its actions, facilitates its coherence with values and invigorates its identity.Design/methodology: The methodology is exploratory and consists of a bibliographic search on companies as living organisms, with different indicators of the business sector, in tune with the allocation and management of resources, process improvement, the good climate of the organization, adequate training and balanced rotation of workers, to enjoy longer life expectancy, with transparency of their financial indicators, non-financial, social, ethical and emotional of the organization.Findings: The application of the Organic Model in organizations contrasts the mechanistic approaches and complete systemic approaches by including the interaction of all the essential forces that make up an organization: its own culture and identity, people, processes and resources.Originality/value: Valuing that a business organization is a living being allows us to have a series of human qualities and not just a set of assets, liabilities and results. An organization with awareness and values generates social, cultural or environmental benefits, beyond its own economic results and interacts with the environment providing added value.",art
10.3926/ic.2426,"A systematic literature review: ESG criteria implementation in the insurance industry. Purpose: Sustainability and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria are gaining more relevance, and the insurance industry is playing a relevant role in the sustainability transition. Therefore, this study aims to review existing academic literature on ESG criteria in the insurance industry. Specifically, it addresses the determinants in three objectives: First, analysing the focus on sustainability considering the three dimensions of the ESG framework: Environment, Social and Governance; the second one, focusing on the relevant topics in the insurance industry involving the ESG criteria. And finally, identifying the main gaps and point out new research lines. Design/methodology/approach: The research was conducted through a systematic literature review considering published articles of Web of Science and Scopus. Findings: Findings contribute to the body of literature on sustainable finance, providing a new and complete overview about how ESG criteria implementation has been approached in the insurance industry: mapping research streams, analysing the ESG approach, and identifying research gaps in this domain, principally in empirical analysis, research in social and governance actions, and in product and customer ESG perspective. Practical implications: This article wants to provide a broader and a more structured knowledge about ESG criteria implementation, and to help managers and insurance companies to move forward with sustainability strategies, and to identify the future lines of research. Social Implications: Business sustainability aims to combine market logic with social welfare logic. This article provide knowledge about how insurance companies develop the social dimension within the ESG perspective, as a way to influence the community by promoting equal practices, access to education, etc. Additionally, it helps society to be more aware of the impacts of climate change and the importance of knowing, assimilating and adopting the SDGs and other material elements about sustainability and ESG criteria. Originality/value: Although the insurance industry has a very relevant weight into the economy and the society, and it plays a key role in promoting the transition to a low-carbon economy, there are not many scientific articles on this subject.",art
10.3926/ic.2228,"Relationship among economic crisis, stock market crashes and accounting scandals. Purpose: This work investigates the relationships between stock exchange crashes and accounting scandals.Design/methodology: We analyze the main accounting scandals and stock exchange crashes that occurred between 1980 and 2020. Findings: First of all, it was verified that a stock market crash occurred in the years in which most of the accounting scandals took place (or within the next three years). This evidence is consistent with much of the previous literature. Second, an average of 5.4 years has been estimated as the period of time that elapses between the time a company starts engaging in accounting deception and the moment when it is discovered and the scandal breaks out. Third, it has been found that accounting deception is more likely to occur in years with stock market crashes and in the years immediately following. The literature review revealed no evidence supporting the two latter hypotheses.Research limitations/implications: This exploratory work has several limitations. First of all, only scandals that have been reported on websites in Spanish and English have been analyzed. Therefore, the sample may be biased, giving more weight to companies from Anglo-Saxon and Spanish-speaking countries. Second, the sample was made up of a small number of companies (53), which are those that have met the search criteria used.Practical implications: The findings of this work are relevant today, since a major stock exchange crash has occurred as a result of the coronavirus. Therefore, if the pattern of the most recent decades is repeated, it would be expected that more accounting scandals will come to light in the coming years.Social implications: The conclusions obtained are of great relevance for the different users of the financial information from companies, and also for auditors, consultants and supervisory bodies, since due to the stock exchange crash triggered by COVID-19, they will need to exercise extreme caution in the coming years in relation to financial information.Originality/value: The work provides evidence on the relationship between stock market crashes and accounting scandals, which is a highly relevant topic. The literature review revealed no study using the same methodology or a similar sample of companies.",art
10.3926/ic.2020,"Does green innovation play an important role in the effect board gender diversity has on firm performance?. Purpose: This research is motivated by the developments in the debates in the literature about addressing the 17 SDGs promoted by the UN, particularly the urgent calls for green innovation and women's empowerment. This study aims to investigate the mediating role of green innovation in the effect board gender diversity has on firm performance.Design/methodology: This research employs regression analysis. The data set comprises a sample of 518 public listed companies on the Indonesia Stock Exchange during the 2017 to 2019 period.Findings: The results demonstrate that the presence of board gender diversity has a negative effect on green innovation and the relationship between green innovation and firm performance is insignificant. However, the results also show that board gender diversity has a positive effect on firm performance. More importantly, green innovation is not an essential factor in the relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance.Research limitations/implications: This research only uses a sample of companies drawn from a single country; therefore, the implications of the results might only apply to emerging countries with similar conditions to Indonesia. Future research needs to have more samples drawn from multiple countries. Also, future research could apply, amongst others things, corporate governance characteristics as variables.Practical implications: The findings from our results can, firstly, be used to support companies seeking to implement alternative low cost green innovations. Secondly, this paper can be used to give insight to the Indonesian government regarding its support for the business-based environment by strengthening the regulations pertaining to the environmental aspects, and providing incentives for companies to implement green innovations. Social implications: Our results can be used as a reference to promote women's participation on the boards of firms. Furthermore, this study also describes the changes in people's behaviour regarding the use and consumption of green products and environmental concerns.Originality/value: Our study contributes to the literature in many ways. First, it contributes to the literature on gender regarding the presence of female directors on boards by demonstrating they have a greater commitment to improving their firms' performance. Second, the findings also provide an important insight into green innovation's role in the relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance. This is still a controversial issue, and here the results show that green innovation is not an important factor in the relationship between gender and improving firm performance.",art
10.3926/ic.2238,"Ethical leadership and creativity in employees with University education: The moderating effect of high intensity telework. Purpose: The main objective of this research is to determine if the number of days teleworked gradually influences the causal relationship between Ethical Leadership and Creativity among university -educated employees together with the aspect of their interaction.Design/methodology: To decipher this question, a simple moderation scheme is chosen. The sample is 448 workers who are evaluated online.Findings: Ethical Leadership and Creativity are related in a convex way; that is, the ethical extremes, low or high, negatively, or positively influence creative performance, in that order. In addition, the intensity of Teleworking favors the integration between Ethical Leadership and original ideas; On the other hand, when remote work is reduced to one day a week, the relationship between Ethical Leadership and Creativity is neutralized. Finally, the self-perception of Creativity is lower in the female gender.Research limitations/implications: It is a cross-sectional study, but the results can be transferred to the entire Colombian energy industry since the sample was taken at different stages and obtained from various sources. Future research can delve into the e-ethics role of ethical leadership. Practical implications: The transition from conventional to electronic leadership needs to be influenced by strong ethical values to avoid leadership styles such as intrusive or abusive leadership that do not consider employee welfare as a priority. In addition, hybrid work alternatives that combine remote days with on-site days make it essential to consider that very low-intensity Teleworking substantially reduces individual Creativity.Social implications: The public energy industries in underdeveloped countries whose main mission is to serve the neediest social spheres cannot take their eyes off the common interest. When this happens, corruption proliferates, and inequalities widen.Originality/value: This research presents a theoretical model that extends the existing literature on Ethical Leadership. The benefits of this management style are widely known, but it is of vital interest to know its impact within a virtual work environment, and even more so when Teleworking becomes an ideal habitat to capitalize on its potential.",art

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate and analyse the influence of intellectual capital on manufacturing company performance, as well as the impact of busy directors on the relationship between intellectual capital and manufacturing company performance in Indonesia.Design/methodology: This study analyse secondary data from the Indonesia Stock Exchange and the official websites of manufacturing companies for the 2016-2020 period. To test the hypotheses, this study used a quantitative method with panel data regression to investigate the relationship between intellectual capital and company performance and the moderating effect of busy directors on the relationship between intellectual capital and company performance.Findings: The results show that intellectual capital has a positive effect on company performance and that busy directors enhance this effect.Research limitations/implications: Indonesian companies are characterised by concentrated ownership and lower investor protection so the result may not be generalised in other contexts.Practical implications: The public-listed Indonesian company should consider the board of commissioners with multiple directorships to strengthen the positive relationship between intellectual capital and company performance.Originality/value: This study highlights and examines the impact of the board of commissioners with multiple directorships on the relationship between intellectual capital and the financial performance of manufacturing companies in Indonesia. Therefore, this study provides a better understanding of the importance of board competency as reflected in multiple directorships that affect the relationship between intellectual capital and company performance.",art
10.3926/ic.2139,"Teleworking and emotional exhaustion in the Colombian electricity sector: The mediating role of affective commitment and the moderating role of creativity. Purpose: After two years during which teleworking has been a temporary obligation, the Colombian electricity sector needs to analyze the effect of this type of work on the well-being of employees. Design/Methodology/Approach: Therefore, this research aims to consider whether teleworking (independent variable) and its intensity, together with an implicit extension of the workday, emotionally exhaust (dependent variable) the members of the different organizations studied. Likewise, it is critical to know if affective commitment acts as a causal mediating process and if creativity influences and moderates the relationship between the variables studied. Consequently, a quantitative, cross-sectional, correlational-causal design is used with a sample of 448 teleworkers. Findinds: Regarding the results, teleworking and its intensity reduce emotional exhaustion and increase affective commitment. Furthermore, affective commitment acts as a mediating mechanism that tends to reduce exhaustion. However, teleworking when accompanied by an excess of creative demands and a lack of assessment of employees' resources, gradually contributes to exhaustion. Finally, the extension of the workday reduces affective commitment and increases emotional exhaustion Research Limitations/Implications: A sector study reduces the generalization of results. Alongside, transversality restricts the accuracy of the temporal relationship between variables. Practical Implications: Developing time management skills is key in teleworking. Also, setting reasonable learning deadlines will reduce possible emotional exhaustion. Finally, leadership has a basic role in digital disconnection policies.Social Implications: The perception that teleworking consolidates the work-family axis and equalizes genders is essential for companies to provide well-being in addition to being sustainable.Originality/value: This research will have an impact on immediate decision-making that the Colombian electricity sector may have. Additionally, it can be useful for other industrial segments.",art
10.3926/ic.1589,"Workplace relationships in Europe: An analysis by occupation and employment status. Purpose: This article analyses the extent to which two objective attributes of work - employment status, and occupation - influence workplace relationships in Europe. Employing a quantitative approach, we explore how far the segmentation of the labour market is reflected in the non-material dimensions of working life, seeing the nature of work and the stabilisation of employment as resources that help explain broader dynamics of job quality.Design/methodology: Based on three indicators of the 6th edition of the European Working Conditions Survey - 2015 (support from colleagues; support from managers; and the quality of relationships), we performed two-way ANOVA to test both the primary effects of the variables 'employment status' and 'occupation' on support and quality of workplace relationships, and their interaction effect. Additionally, we carried out a descriptive analysis of the mean scores of each of the dependent variables in the various groups of the independent variables. The survey's sample consists of 43,850 workers from 35 European countries, randomly selected by strata of the active population in each country.Findings: The results show that workers with more stable jobs, and those who occupy positions at the top of the ISCO-08 classification, enjoy more support and better interpersonal relationships, thus suggesting the need to extend labour market segmentation discussions to the relational spheres of work.Research limitations/implications: The statistical indicators used need a more robust operationalisation, able to provide greater empirical validity. Other independent variables, such as the perceptions of job security or the country of work should be considered in future analysis to control for institutional and policy specificities.Originality/value: Research on workplace relationships tends to emphasise the effects that such relationships have on both organisations and individuals, usually based on case studies and individual narratives of relationships formed in stable work contexts. In this article, we shift the focus from the effects of workplace relationships, to the ways in which they vary in accordance with the nature of work and the objective employment conditions.",art
10.3926/ic.1876,"Evaluation of entrepreneurial behavior of technology-based companies in stages of the business life cycle. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the entrepreneurial behavior of managers of technology-based companies in specific stages of the business life cycle. Design/methodology: Structured questionnaire based on the entrepreneurial behavior characteristics was applied to the thirty-one managers of the technology-based companies mapped for the paper. The collected data were processed by the Hierarchical Process Analysis (AHP) technique in a multicriterial approach to measure the entrepreneurial behavior according stages of the business life cycle. Findings: The results of the paper show that the level of entrepreneurial behavior of managers follows the development of the company. Managers working in technology-based companies at later stages of the business life cycle showed more entrepreneurial characteristics. The results showed that the experience that the manager acquires as the company evolves influences his or her behavior and consequently the company's performance. Moreover, certain characteristics could be related to the particularities of each stage of the business life cycle. Originality/value: The results of this paper can provide managers with understanding of how entrepreneurial behaviors diversify according to the stage of the technology-based company. Since both entrepreneurial behavior and the stages of the business life cycle influence the performance of technology-based companies, the results provide important knowledge for managers to improve their businesses. These managers can use the contributions of the paper as a management practice throughout the stages of their existence, which may provide the adoption of more appropriate strategies, being a connection between the theory studied and the business practices.",art

Purpose: Biotechnology has gained such prominence in the past years that approximately 50% of new drugs developed worldwide are of biotechnological origin. Some of the Covid-19 vaccines are a good example of this development. However, biotechnology R&D projects are characterized by high costs, prolonged development times, and a high degree of uncertainty and failure. Only few types of financial agents undertake such risky investments, among which are venture capital firms. In this paper, we analyse the signals that influence suchlike venture capital investment decisions. The very high level of risk, which differentiates biotechnology firms from other technology companies, justifies an analysis focused solely on biotechnology firms.Design/methodology: Hypotheses about the effectiveness of these signals are validated by means of a probit regression with panel data on a sample of 210 biotechnology companies established in Spain over a ten-year period.Findings: A positive and negative signalling effect has been found for some of the phenomena analysed, which validate the proposed model.Research limitations/implications: A convenience sample has been used for methodological reasons. Some phenomena that could have some effect on the venture capital investment decisions have not been possible to observe.Practical implications: It can be crucial for biotechnology firms for their managers to know which characteristics make these firms attractive to venture capital firms. Additionally, it is important to be aware of signals that, instead of favouring investment decisions, deter them.Originality/value: This is the first study conducted for the Spanish industry to focus on the first venture capital investment - rather than the typical focus on the amount invested-as an event that mitigates the information asymmetry level, and which includes also a distinction between four types of strategic alliance, the use of a probit regression with panel data, and a quantitative analysis on the biotech industry.As the Spanish biotechnology and venture capital industries differ from those established in other European countries, this work offers new elements of analysis, description, and comparison of these industries. In addition, the construction of a database on a sample of 210 Spanish biotechnology firms is unprecedented and can be used for future research.",art
10.3926/ic.2221,"The organic model and ethical banking: The importance of identity. Purpose: The aim of this work is to highlight the advantages of applying the Organic Model to organizations. It considers the example of European Ethical Banking, which came about as the result of the impetus of this model. This work highlights the trajectory of Ethical Banking in Spain and examines why it has not been affected by a crisis that triggered the disappearance of dozens of centennial Savings Banks.Design/methodology: An exploratory methodology is used, consisting of a bibliographic search for the influence of the Organic Model on the creation of European Ethical Banking. The history of Ethical Banking in Spain is also analyzed, contrasting it with that of the Savings Banks in the same period. Interviews are included with prominent individuals associated with Ethical Banking and the Organic Model.Findings: The Organic Model places paramount importance on Identity in organizations. Ethical Banking and the Savings Banks had similar fundamental impulses, but the latter gradually lost their identity. This work relates the crisis that led to the disappearance of the Savings Banks to their loss of Identity. In the same context, Ethical Banking was reinforced in Spain.Originality/value: The structural division of the Organic Model to analyze organizations (with their own culture and identity, people, processes and resources) facilitates the fulfillment of their purpose and preserves the influence of values in decision-making. The Organic Model provides coherence to the members of the organization and aligns them with its identity. The economic results are not the ultimate goal, but the consequence of efficiently carrying out the mission, and at the same time they provide positive value to society, culture and the environment. It is a shared benefit.",art
10.3926/ic.2547,"Bridging sentiment and finance: An exploration of BOD statements and bank ratios in Jordan. Purpose: This study explores the intricate interplay between sentiment extracted from Board of Directors (BOD) statements and the traditional financial metrics of banks. It investigates the relationship between a bank's financial performance, measured by various financial ratios, and the sentiment expressed in BOD statements. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing from a dataset encompassing BOD statements from 15 Jordanian banks spanning 2017 to 2021, sentiment analysis techniques are employed to derive sentiment scores. These scores are then juxtaposed with principal components distilled from financial metrics to examine their predictive relationship. Findings: Preliminary findings reveal significant non-linear patterns between Hu and Liu's (2004) sentimental analysis (Lui_sen), the Data Science Lab's (n.d.) multilingual sentiment tool (multi_sen), and the principal components. A subsequent random-effects panel regression further elucidates these relationships, highlighting the significant influence of specific principal components on sentiment scores. This study provides a compelling case for integrating sentiment analysis with traditional financial indicators, offering a more comprehensive toolkit for evaluating bank performance. Research limitations/implications: Future research should explore broader datasets across multiple sectors, to validate the generalisability of the findings beyond the banking sector in Jordan. Practical implications: This research holds implications for investors, analysts, and stakeholders by combining sentiment analysis with traditional financial metrics. It offers deeper insights into the health of banks and the intentions of management. This integrated approach allows stakeholders to make informed decisions and mitigate risks based on a more comprehensive view of banks' financial situations. Additionally, the possibility of real-time sentiment analysis enables the dynamic monitoring of banking institutions' financial health as updated data becomes available. Social implications: The study's results are valuable to users of financial information, aiding the Association of Banks and the Central Bank of Jordan in formulating policies for the banking sector. Auditors, consultants, and regulatory bodies in Jordan can also benefit from these insights. Originality/value: This is the first study exploring the relationship between sentiment extracted from BOD statements and traditional financial metrics in Jordan. It provides novel evidence of this relationship, contributing to the literature on the integration of textual data analysis and financial performance.",art
10.3926/ic.2922,"Key organisational barriers to effective knowledge risk management in South African public sector enterprises. Purpose: The aim of this study was to delve into the obstacles preventing the effective management of tacit knowledge risks in South African public sector enterprises (PSEs) from the perspectives of human resource management (HRM) and knowledge management (KM). A perusal of the literature reveals that most South African PSEs are grappling with significant challenges related to potential tacit knowledge loss risks. Design/methodology/approach: The research utilised a mixed methods exploratory sequential design, collecting qualitative data through interviews with 20 HR managers in 9 PSEs and survey data from 585 questionnaires. The reliability of the data was tested, and thematic analysis was performed using Atlas.ti software. Findings: The study identified key barriers to effective tacit knowledge loss risk management in PSEs, including a silo mentality, organisational red-tape, knowledge as a power source, lack of recognition and rewards, KM awareness, cultures and structures, employment equity, fixed-term contracts, competing priorities for leadership, knowledge hoarding, HRM practices, and inadequate KM technologies and systems. These pressing issues need to be addressed to improve knowledge risk management (KRM) efforts in PSEs. Research limitations/implications: The exploration of organisational barriers was only limited to the tacit knowledge loss risks category, induced by human resource turnover in country-specific PSEs. Future studies could explore the organisational barriers and factors affecting other types of knowledge risks in PSEs or similar knowledge-intensive business enterprises across the globe using different samples and populations. Other similar studies could include strategic sectors of the economy such as energy generation, civil aviation, defence, mining and rail. The study contributes to the knowledge-based view and knowledge stickiness theories, and proposes an interdisciplinarity approach using mixed methods for future research on tacit knowledge loss. Practical implications: The research findings conclusively indicate that PSEs face the aforementioned barriers that hinder the effective implementation of the KRM system. This study identifies that key organisational barriers were mainly due to a lack of knowledge-driven HRM strategies in KM. To address these barriers, HR managers and other stakeholders must collaborate to ensure effective knowledge management and mitigate the negative impact of knowledge loss risks on organisational performance. Social Implications: The study highlights the importance of removing key barriers for improved KRM in PSEs. The improved KRM can enhance public service delivery efficiency, transparency and the accountability of PSEs by addressing socio-economic developmental issues in developing economies. Originality/value: Using South African PSEs as a case to address this challenge, the paper sought to explore key organisational barriers to effective knowledge loss risk management in organisations with a view to shaping discourse, policies, research, theories and practices in KM and HRM. Organisational barriers affecting the management of such risks remain unexplored in the extant body of knowledge and practice.",art
10.3926/ic.1746,"The resilience factors of the agri-food supply chain: An integrative review of the literature in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Purpose: During the COVID-19 global pandemic, a very significant change has occurred in the demand for basic goods, resulting from the change in the consumer needs of the population in light of a large-scale health and economic crisis. This has revealed the true importance that the agri-food supply chains (ASC) have in the design of business strategies, especially at exceptional times, when the logistics process must be robust enough to continue to ensure the supply of products. In this context, the article presents a qualitative review of the academic literature, with the aim of extracting those factors that have the greatest influence on the degree of resilience of the ASC.Design/methodology: The methodology used is the integrative review of scientific publications, with a closer focus on those specialized in the supply chain, in order to perform a critical analysis and demonstrate theory based on the existing evidence. Both the document search and the content analysis abide by rigorous, explicit criteria.Findings: The bibliographic analysis reveals that there are at least three business strategies that can be considered critical factors in the degree of resilience of the ASCs. These three strategies are: a customer-oriented business awareness; distribution models based on proximity; and cooperative practices among the factors that make up the value chains.Originality/value: In such an important historical moment as the Coronavirus pandemic, it is very appropriate to look back in order to analyze all the scientific literature that could help us to better understand the current situation. It is even more important to do so in those areas of knowledge that do not yet have a consolidated academic trajectory, such as in the case of the resilience of supply chains.",art
10.3926/ic.2297,"The impact of active learning on entrepreneurial capacity. Purpose: This paper intends to shed light on the teaching-leaning methodologies that best contribute to developing entrepreneurial competences. Design/methodology: We pose an active learning model that integrates the content of three subjects from the field of marketing in a single business project. We also measure the impact of this model on entrepreneurial competences through a validated questionnaire. The measurement instrument includes the short FINCODA questionnaire version to assess innovative behaviour and creativity, and indicators from the GEM survey on entrepreneurial perceptions for assessment of entrepreneurial spirit. Findings: The results show a slightly positive effect on creativity and innovation capacity but that some active models may not be sufficient to develop skills linked to starting up projects or risk-taking. Originality/value: It seems reasonable to consider rethinking the teaching-learning model used with marketing students in order to boost greater development of their entrepreneurial capacity. Setting up systems that promote greater engagement between universities and social, cultural or business agents in their area could foster entrepreneurial competences. This paper contribute to the debate on education policies that drive entrepreneurship and the possibility of designing new education models.",art

Purpose: This paper intends to scrutinize evolution and the growth of literature on green intellectual capital(GIC)over the period 2008 to 2022, consequences of green intellectual capital, its sectoral classification, current trends and future scope of research. Design/methodology: For a better understanding of this concept, a systematically arranged review was performed following PRISMA framework. For this, data has been extracted from Scopus and Web of Science databases because they are the largest databases and provide international coverage. Collected data was confined on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The paper was sectioned into two types of analysis: bibliometric analysis and content analysis. Findings: Results highlighted that green intellectual capital has important meanings in influencing organisational performance namely economic, social and financial performance. Studies were focused mainly on Asian countries using quantitative analysis and deduced that researchers were mainly focused on manufacturing sector. Findings depict that GIC translates into explicit results but when its components' effects are analysed, they individually show ambiguous results.Research limitations/implications: This study will provide useful insights to researchers, practitioners, managers and policy makers. Findings suggest intangible resource-green intellectual capital should be managed efficaciously which will provide competitive benefits and also contribute to organisations' financial, social and environmental performance.Originality/value: The existing literature needs to be comprehended and streamlined by interpreting the nuances in the existing research work for enabling synergy in deciphering the explicit outcomes of the extant literature. Also, there are only a few studies focusing on this construct and on its systematic literature review.",art
10.3926/ic.1505,"The role of social media as a voluntary intellectual capital disclosure in universities: Evidence from Indonesia. Purpose: This research explains the influence of social media as a tool for the voluntary disclosure of intellectual capital on university performance.Design/methodology: All universities in Indonesia were analyzed based on the observation of their social media accounts such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube channels after which they were correlated with the university performance.Findings: The results showed that social media can be used as voluntary disclosure of intellectual capital. This was indicated by the positive correlation between the popularity of the universities on social media and their relational capital and institutional performance. However, no impact was found on the number of students but a significant difference was recorded in the use of social media between public and private universities in Indonesia.Research limitations/implications: The data were obtained only from one country and this means there is a need to analyze several other countries with different social media platforms in the future.Practical implications: From a strategic management perspective, this is an opportunity for universities to manage social media effectively in order to increase the popularity of their cyberspace and institutional performance. It is recommended that universities have a special role in managing their social media content in order to be able to develop and manage digital communications effectively as a strategy to improve the performance of institutions.Social implications: Social media plays a vital role in improving an organization's performance and providing adequate information to stakeholders. This is important because the existence of intangible assets is critical to the survival of a business.Originality/value: This research empirically examines the impact of using social media on public -sector organizations (universities) with a specific focus on its application as a voluntary disclosure tool of intellectual capital.",art

Purpose: This paper performs a comprehensive bibliometric investigation of the role of intangible capital in the economics literature and aims to identify unanswered questions and gaps to guide future research. Design/methodology: The systematic literature review concerned with intangible capital employed bibliometric methods, including the obtaining of datasets from reputable article databases (Scopus), dataset preprocessing and refinement of records, construction and visualisation of networks, and analysis and interpretation that among others involved standard descriptive and qualitative analyses. Findings: The study highlights that the economics literature on intangible capital focuses on productivity research on the micro, meso and macro levels by showing how intangibles positively impact productivity. Yet, at the same time the results reveal a gap in understanding the mechanism of transmission or the 'why' and 'how' of the impact. Originality and Value: This study is the first comprehensive bibliometric analysis of intangible capital in economics and complements the earlier limited approaches by conducting a systematic review of research in this area. Further, gaps are identified while the need for deeper understanding of the mechanisms of intangible capital's transmission to productivity is highlighted. Limitations: The overview of the field given means the research is limited by the lack of detailed analysis for each topic determined to be relevant. Still, future research could identify variables of interest and existing causal mechanisms for each issue to explain how intangible capital affects productivity and spillover effects.",art
10.3926/ic.1542,"Entrepreneurial skills in university degrees. Purpose: From a skills perspective, the academic field of entrepreneurship has grown to become a key element in university studies. Determining whether these skills exist among university students and how to foster them is a key in higher education. To this effect, the aim of this study is to determine the entrepreneurial skills' level among the students on the different disciplines. The empirical application considers the case of the Faculty of Business and Economics Sciences of University of Girona.Design/methodology: Information about the skill level was collected using a skills model called Tricuspoid, which was specifically designed for the self-assessment of entrepreneurial skills. Information about students' sociodemographic, professional and educational profile was collected using a self-administered complementary questionnaire. Bivariate analysis and statistical contrast were applied.Findings: Being a man, doing sport, balancing studying with paid work and accessing university studies via the vocational training pathway are indicators of a greater entrepreneurial capacity. On the other hand, being a woman, accessing university studies via baccalaureate or having no knowledge of English, however, are factors associated with a deficit in entrepreneurial talent.Originality/value: Considering the fact that attitude to entrepreneurship can be modified through educational interventions, identifying these factors enables us to formulate guidelines for teaching activities that increase students' entrepreneurial and intrapreneurial capacity for a better integration for our students into the job market.",art

Purpose: The primary objective of this study is to uncover the complex relationship between cryptocurrency prices and significant global events that transpired within the past five years. These events encompass a wide spectrum, including political and global health crises, the public disclosure of multinational enterprises' investments in cryptocurrencies, and the influence of macroeconomic indicators. Beyond the exclusive focus on Bitcoin, this study adopts a more comprehensive approach encompassing various cryptocurrencies. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the effects of the disclosure of cryptocurrency adoption plans by major corporations, the Russian -Ukraine war, Covid-19, Inflation rate, and Economic policy uncertainty within the U.S., U.K., and E.U on cryptocurrency prices (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance coin) using a structural equation model over the past five years. Findings: Our findings provided several compelling insights. Most notably, during the study period major corporations' adoption of cryptocurrencies positively influenced their price. Furthermore, a negative and significant association emerges between cryptocurrency prices and periods marked by economic policy uncertainty and inflation rates in the countries under investigation (U.S., U.K., and E.U). The results are robust under variations in sample composition and changes in sets of variables. Originality/value: The study uncovered the complex relationship between cryptocurrency price fluctuations and significant global events that transpired within the past five years by taking the factors identified in previous literature as a whole and adding new variables that are not well studied, such as the effect of Russian -Ukraine War and multinational corporations revealing cryptocurrency adoption intention on the prices of cryptocurrencies. This study represents a pivotal contribution by bridging a crucial research void and providing theoretical insights into the legal considerations to be undertaken by policymakers, and informed investment practices by traders, and corporate leaders.",art

10.3926/ic.2267,"Winning post strategies that generate engagement: A QCA approach. Purpose: Fashion companies are using an increasing amount of resources to generate social media content to provoke an impact and engage customers. A wrong message or image - but also an inaccurate combination of the different elements that characterise a post - can jeopardise brand reputation. The way brands communicate with potential customers is of utmost importance as it creates its online identity and presence, and this is ultimately linked to customer loyalty. Given that a post contains different elements (e.g., image, people, background) this study seeks to explore which combination(s) of elements should brands consider to generate superior user engagement with their posts.Design/methodology: After conducting a comprehensive literature review on social media marketing a set of critical factors that relate to content engagement are envisioned. Next, drawing on complexity and configuration theories, we perform fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to identify different strategies (i.e., combinations of critical factors) companies might follow to engage with customers successfully. The empirical application focuses on the Instagram activity of a retail clothing company.Findings: The findings reveal that posts conducive to superior engagement should: (i) be simple, product-related or experience-related, (ii) use few but meaningful hashtags that are representative of the brand, (iii) show people's faces, and (iv) send an inclusive message.Practical implications: This study sheds new light on how brands should communicate on social media networks to generate improved impact for their posts.Originality/value: This study goes beyond traditional approaches that overlook the joint effect of the different strategic design choices (i.e., combination of critical factors) for posts on the outcomes of interest (in our case, number of likes, comments and views).",art

Purpose: This research presents a method proposal to analyse the viability of entrepreneurial projects in critical contexts of developing countries. Design/methodology: The method proposal is applied to a case study on the integral viability analysis of a shea mill in Kumbungu (Ghana). Based on a qualitative design, different ad hoc participatory tools are implemented, such as a daily routine schedule, combined with other research techniques (focus groups, interviews, etc.). Findings: The proposal includes ten specific steps to analyse the viability of entrepreneurial projects. It involves, on the one hand, the active participation of the members of the community in order to be able to make a real analysis of their needs; and, on the other hand, an integrating analysis that allows evaluating the sustainability of the project from an economic, social and technological perspective. The method is applied to the start-up and management of a shea butter mill in Ghana. Some core aspects are highlighted: 1) people are considered key when making decisions, thus participatory tools (such as the daily routines workshop) can be essential in ensuring the sustainability of the enterprise; 2) the need to adapt the tools to the context. This is crucial in contexts such as Ghana, where language may be a barrier or because the illiteracy rate is high. And 3) from the method, it is concluded that it is necessary to prioritise the sustainability of the enterprise in general, not just efficiency. Originality/value: The research combines the classic tools of business viability analysis with those of development cooperation. In this sense, it is proposed to carry out an integral viability analysis that includes not only the economic sustainability of the project, but also the social and technological aspects and, more important, where the active participation of all the stakeholders is considered.",art

Purpose: This study examines the impact of social media influencers (SMIs) on online repurchase intentions through brand trust and customer engagement in the cosmetics sector. Design/methodology/approach: The study framework and hypotheses in this paper were tested using a questionnaire survey approach, with the consumer as the unit of analysis. The study's main target was individuals who purchase cosmetics products through social media platforms. Questionnaire items were created using a measurement scale employed in an earlier study. A Likert scale of seven points, ranging from 1 to 7, was used to grade the questionnaire items. Responses ranged from strong disagreement to strong agreement. Findings: In general, this study revealed that social media influencers have a significant positive direct impact on brand trust, customer brand engagement, and online repurchase intentions. Moreover, social media influencers were the most vital determinant of online repurchase intention, followed by brand trust and customer brand engagement. Moreover, customer brand engagement had a significant positive impact on brand trust. Additionally, brand trust and customer brand engagement impacted significantly and positively on online repurchase intention. The mediation analysis results found that customer brand engagement did not mediate the positive impact of social media influencers on online repurchase intention. Furthermore, it was found that brand trust mediated the positive impact of social media influencers on online repurchase intentions. This study is among the first to offer empirical evidence to demonstrate that social media influencers act as a route to online repurchase intention through brand trust and customer brand engagement. Research limitations/implications: This study has several limitations. The first one is that it was only conducted in one country. Using samples from a single country (Jordan) may produce culture-specific findings that are difficult to generalise across other settings. The second limitation of this study is related to the target population. In this study, researchers surveyed individuals who purchased cosmetics products through social media platforms. Practical implications: As the use of social media rises, social media influencers have an ever-greater impact on customers' online purchase and repurchase intentions, as customers deem influencers to be ideal role models they aim to imitate. Originality/value: The study is highly valuable for marketing strategies, as social media influencers have a powerful impact on effective marketing strategies.",art

10.3926/ic.2425,"Is crypto legitimate? Study on the relationship between legitimacy and public engagement on crypto market in Indonesia. Purpose: In recent years, the development of the crypto market has grown exponentially compared to other investment assets. Using the lens of institutional entrepreneurship theory, our research seeks to understand the antecedents of public engagement on crypto market in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: To capture this phenomenon, we use institutional and legitimacy theories to explain how social constructs toward cryptocurrency can be formed and accepted by society. Based on the survey of 213 individuals actively engaging in the crypto market, we confirm that public engagement in the crypto market is associated with three different types of legitimacy Findings: The main contribution of this research is that it shows that normative and cognitive legitimacies play a big role in public engagement in the crypto market. This study also found that, in general, individuals engaged in crypto are individuals who only focus on personal gain. They can engage with the crypto market if their personal goals are met. Research limitations/implications: This research is only carried out within the geographical boundaries of Indonesia. It is imperative to conduct investigations in various contexts in order to comprehend how diverse cultural contexts can potentially impact public engagement in the crypto market. Practical implications: This study provides support for the notion that public engagement in the crypto market is correlated with different levels of legitimacy. The results of this study show that public participation in the crypto market is significantly influenced by normative and cognitive legitimacies. Social implications: This research can be helpful for policymakers and industries able to consider the institutional development of crypto ecosystems and will generate fresh insight into our understanding of the nature of legitimacy-seeking behavior among cryptocurrency adopters Originality/value: We propose a new mechanism explaining how institutional frameworks could help explain the emergence of public engagement on Crypto Market.",art
10.3926/ic.2312,"Fake news and youngsters' decision journey: An evaluation of the influence of misinformation on social media. Purpose: Social media has changed the way users interact with each other, and has become an important part of numerous lives. However, there is an increasing flow of implausible content circulating on social media, which points to the need for some categorization and regulation. This study will examine how the proliferation of fake news on social media impacts students and their choice of university. To answer this question, market research was conducted on the precedents that affect the acceptance of fake news among university students when choosing to study for a master's degree that will help them in their professional careers.Design/methodology: The study used a quantitative method. A parsimonious model of causal relationships was proposed based on scales taken from the literature, assessed by a convenience sample of students, and adjusted by structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings: Results show that the parsimonious model explains 35% of fake news acceptance and that media dependency (ISMD) and parasocial interaction (PSI) are the main direct effects, while perceived media richness (PR) has a significant indirect influence on the attitude towards fake news and, consequently, on its acceptance. Furthermore, fake news literacy plays a correct moderating role with the most relevant source of influence, SNS dependency.Research limitations/implications: A convenience sample was used, and a parsimonious model with three antecedent factors and one mediating factor was proposed. Other social factors could have been considered, including multicultural variables.Practical implications: The results point to students' expressed dependence on social networks as the main factor explaining their attitude towards fake news, negatively moderated by students' level of knowledge about the importance of this phenomenon in social networks. Therefore, it is relevant to promote knowledge about this phenomenon among students to reduce its influence on decision-making processes.Originality/value: This paper provides a novel context for the study of the proliferation of fake news on social networks: the process of choosing a university by students addicted to the news circulating on social media.",art

Purpose: The purpose of this research is to analyze the degree of transparency reports (TR) transparency and its relation with the audit firm size, fees, either from audit services, or from other services, and with the human capital.Design/methodology: In this study we considered 282 audit firms, and our final sample includes 268 transparency reports from 2013 through 2017. For the period under analysis, audit firms financial information, human resources information and TR were collected. TR report information was divided in four types of information: Mandatory Information I, Mandatory Information II, Voluntary Information and Extra Information. These indexes measure the fulfillment of each information on the total of information considered in each index. Non-parametric tests were applied to analyze the behavior of each index for the different years, whereas the Generalized Linear Models were performed to study the impact of various factors on each disclosure index.Findings: Our results show a high level of transparency regarding Mandatory Information I, but a lower accomplishment regarding all other information. In general, the auditor experience, the number of auditors, the number of clients that are public-interest entities (PIE) and the percentage of extra audit services have a significant impact on the information disclosed in the TR.Originality/value: Our paper contributes to the current literature by assessing the influence that human capital has on the information disclosed in the transparency reports, also it covers a 5-year period and the compliance with the new disclosures added by Regulation No. 537/2014.",art

Purpose: This article addresses the main concerns of existing literature about resistance to change (RC) in organizations, namely the limited interpretative position regarding RC focusing mainly on negative aspects and excluding potential benefits, and the poor consensus or even understanding of RC sources in organizations.Design/methodology: To approach our goal, a systematic literature review will be carried out. The initial sample, obtained using reproducible search algorithms on Scopus and Web of Science, comprises 65 papers. After applying five inclusion/exclusion criteria supported by previous systematic reviews, the final sample consists of 30 papers.Findings: This article demonstrates the prevalence of a negative position toward RC and reveals efforts to harness the potential benefits of RC. In addition, from 126 specific RC sources extracted from the analyzed papers, it discovers and discusses 22 sub-typologies of RC sources, which are grouped into five typologies.Practical implications: The paper enables the future identification of, evaluation of, and intervention in 22 potential RC sources in organizations distinguished into five typologies. The taxonomy also enables researchers to organize and summarize study topics/subtopics regarding RC in the organizational arena.Social implications: This paper draws attention to the need to recognize the meaning and implications of three alternative positions relating to RC in organizations (positive, negative, and neutral).Originality/value: The paper provides a comprehensive taxonomy of RC sources beyond the traditional classification of individual/organizational factors.",art
10.3926/ic.2056,"Financial inclusion of remittance recipients and non-recipients in Mexico. Purpose: Remittance reception plays a relevant role in Mexican household economies, as Mexico was the world's fourth highest remittances recipient in 2019. Studies about remittance reception have focused on the factors that explain their reception, their primary uses or whether they generate development in the receiving communities. However, the analysis of the relationship between remittance reception and financial inclusion has been relatively neglected. The primary goal of this research is to analyze the characteristics of remittance receiving and non-receiving households and how they are associated with their financial inclusion, as well as the main institutional actions aimed at providing financial inclusion.Design/methodology: A quantitative study using the National Financial Inclusion Survey of 2015 was carried out. A principal component analysis was calculated to generate a financial inclusion index. A latent class analysis was estimated to group the index into three categories to carry out a descriptive analysis. An ordinary least squares linear regression model was estimated to study the effects of remittance reception and the socio-demographic characteristics on financial inclusion.Findings: A low percentage of Mexicans have high financial inclusion. By focusing on the main characteristics of remittance recipients and non-recipients associated with financial inclusion, it was found that the main variables that explain this inclusion are: age-the older the age, the more inclusion-, being a head of household, schooling level-the more schooling, the more inclusion-, living in urban areas, having a job, and receiving remittances. There are several financial inclusion strategies implemented by the Mexican government. However, these strategies have not been accompanied by plans to make the public aware of the pros and cons of acquiring the various financial products offered by banks.Originality/value: It is important to consider the economic benefits that financial inclusion generates, as well as some of the negative implications it can bring to households, like indebtedness.",art
10.3926/ic.1440,"Talent identification and location: A configurational approach to talent pools. Purpose: Talent management (TM) has become a strategic priority for companies seeking to identify employees with outstanding performances and the potential to hold strategic positions in the future. In fact, talent is considered an intangible capital that adds value to the organisation. However, there are only a handful of studies in the literature that address the process of identifying talent in organisations for its subsequent development. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to reach a better understanding of the process of identifying and locating talent, while proposing a configurational approach as a theoretical framework for grouping talented individuals into different configurations or talent pools to initiate talent development in firms.Design/methodology: Case study methodology research based on four companies that have implemented TM programmes in Spain.Findings: The research questions formulated here and the case studies shed light on the process of identifying talent and on the criteria for grouping it in order to facilitate its future development. Our results highlight the following. First, talent means people with certain characteristics. Second, companies focus more on developing the talent identified than on considering the innate nature of that talent. Finally, talent can be found throughout an organisation, in both management and non-management positions. In turn, we conclude with the relevant theoretical contribution of the configurational approach to explain that a company's future competitive advantage is based on the different talent pools existing in its organisation that group talent for its differential management.Practical implications: Our results imply major recommendations for companies on how to identify talent and group it into talent pools in order to implement a process of differentiated management involving a range of temporal pathways.Originality/value: The identification and location of talent, as well as grouping it into talent pools, is an essential prior process for proposing the talent architecture that is so much in demand in the literature.",art

Given the dearth of information on why, how, and when workplace ostracism affects targets' knowledge hiding behavior, the present study examines the effect of workplace ostracism on knowledge hiding with workplace withdrawal as a mediator and authentic leadership as a moderator. A two-phase mixed method research design was used where the quantitative phase of data collection and analysis was followed by the qualitative phase. In the quantitative phase, the hypothesized model was tested using a three-wave time-lagged multi- study (Study 1: hotels and Study 2: banks) design for better generalizability. The findings of the quantitative survey were validated qualitatively using case study method in Study 3. The results demonstrated a significant positive influence of workplace ostracism on knowledge hiding behaviors, and workplace withdrawal was found to mediate this relationship. The results also provided support for the moderated mediation model by establishing the buffering effect of authentic leadership on the direct and indirect relationship between workplace ostracism and knowledge hiding through workplace withdrawal. This study makes important theoretical contributions to workplace mistreatment literature and incentivizes practicing managers to address the issue of workplace ostracism by providing empirical evidence on its undesirable negative consequences.",art

This study extends the existing discourse on employability. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, we contend that workaholism (a pull factor) and job insecurity (a push factor) constitute two critical antecedents that predict sustained employability. Moreover, we investigate the mediating roles of job crafting and presenteeism. To explain and test these predictions, we employed a mixed-methods approach and conducted two studies. Study 1 was an exploratory study to explore the hidden motives behind presenteeism that can predict sustained employability. The findings (themes) from this study guide the conceptual framework tested in the second study. In Study 2, we conducted a field survey across two waves on 498 employees from private sector educational institutions. The results reveal that both the pull factor (workaholism) and push factor (job insecurity) predict sustained employability through two distinct paths. Furthermore, promotion-oriented job crafting and approach-motives presenteeism serially mediate the relationship between workaholism and sustained employability, whereas prevention-oriented job crafting and avoidance-motives presenteeism serially mediate the relationship between job insecurity and sustained employability. These findings offer valuable insights for organizations and HR managers, enabling them to create more supportive and adaptive work environments that align with varied employee approaches to sustained employability.",art

This paper adds a novel perspective to employee voice literature by thematically analysing 36 in-depth interviews of surgeons and anaesthesiologists, who work together but in the context of a blurred hierarchy. We found that these two professions effectively leveraged expertise in speaking up on safety concerns relating to their own speciality, when speaking to each other, irrespective of hierarchy. Further, as interdependent roles make cross speciality voice vital for patient safety, they also spoke up on occasions to negotiate risk and safety concerns across speciality. However, power struggles and protection of speciality authority predisposed each professional group to undervaluing the contribution of the other and often attributing self-interest and opportunistic motives to those speaking up. This led to each group resisting influence making silence a commonplace on cross speciality safety concerns. These contexts present an intriguing environment for voice behaviour which requires research and management attention.",art

This paper examines the intersection between job quality and innovation by exploring policy-led innovation aimed at delivering high-quality adult social care jobs that attract and retain much-needed skilled workers. Through qualitative enquiry, we examine workforce policy's emphasis on training, development and career progression, key elements of job quality, to create higher-skilled, higher-status roles. Drawing on focus groups and interviews with care providers and care workers in Wales (UK), we question the likely success of policy-led innovation given first its ineffective delivery and second its failure to address broader aspects of job quality. Policy thus fails both to institutionalise skilled roles in care work and to raise the status of the care worker occupation. We contribute to emerging HRM and interdisciplinary theory and policy debates about the complex nature of innovation activities and their outcomes for job quality in care work within a sector typified by low-quality jobs. We illustrate the different ways in which job quality and innovation interact and how both can be constrained by one another as a function of environmental antecedents.",art
10.1080/09585192.2023.2263347,"How does managerial consultation backfire pertaining to employee voice pressure?. In response to managerial consultation, employees are likely to be pressured yes-persons. In this paper, we propose the concept of voice pressure and explore its antecedent of managerial consultation and differential voice consequences (i.e. challenging vs. supportive voice). Using a time-lagged survey of 346 employees and their direct leaders in mainland China, we found that managerial consultation could lead to employee voice pressure. We also found that after controlling for the social exchange mechanism (i.e. leader-member exchange) and enabling mechanism (i.e. voice efficacy), the 'managerial consultation-voice pressure-challenging voice' relationship is negative, while the 'managerial consultation-voice pressure-supportive voice' relationship is positive. Furthermore, these indirect relationships are pronounced when employee power distance orientation is higher (vs. lower). We provide a new perspective for the interpretation of managerial consultation; it puts voice pressure on employees and makes them more likely to be managers' yes-persons. Therefore, managers who expect constructive challenging ideas should conduct consultation selectively and discreetly according to employees' attitudes towards power inequalities (i.e. power distance orientation).",art

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced expatriates in many organizations to do virtual work, while virtual communication is becoming a critical skill, especially for second-language speakers. We explore how expatriates with high and low levels of host-country language (HCL) proficiency use different mechanisms to improve their virtual work adaptivity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing upon the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) theory, we argue that expatriates with high HCL proficiency tend to adopt approach crafting, whereas expatriates with low HCL proficiency tend to use avoidance crafting. We further examine the role of language-related human resource (HR) practices in reducing the tendency of expatriates with low HCL proficiency to choose avoidance crafting. We tested our predictions using data collected from 994 expatriates working in eight countries during the COVID-19 virtual work period, and the results generally supported our hypotheses. Our study sheds light on the importance of HCL skills in influencing expatriates' job-crafting behavior and adaptivity in virtual work, and the significant role of language-related HR practices. Last, we offer practical insights into improving virtual work during a crisis in relation to employees' HCL and organizational support.",art

Military veterans often transition into the civilian workforce after serving in a nation's armed forces. The process of integrating this unique class into organizations is directly affected by the social exchanges and interactions in the organization. Utilizing an in-depth interviews-based qualitative study of 40 veterans across 12 different organizations, and integrating social identity theory, we use template analysis to identify a paradox existent in social exchanges with other organizational members where veterans are simultaneously stigmatized and socially aggrandized. These paradoxical experiences interact with veterans' self-conceptualization and social identities to reinforce expectations, cause culture shock and eventual turnover. We present a model of this tension, contributing to literatures on veterans in the workforce, paradox, and social identity theory as well as offering HR perspectives on this phenomenon.",art

In this paper, we argue that adopting a human-centred approach to human resource management (HRM) will contribute to building sustainable workforces, organizations, communities and societies against a backdrop of a global pandemic and political and economic uncertainty. The economic and social cost of the pandemic will continue to be felt for years to come, and the road to recovery should be human-centred and sustainable, with built-in climate actions as part of the socio-economic rejuvenation programme. We draw on several cross-cutting themes to illustrate how the use of digital technology and how remote working, for example, may impact workers from different socio-economic backgrounds in diverse ways. We call for researchers to engage in in-depth qualitative research to identify new phenomena related to work and HRM in the context of accelerating adoption of digital technology and post-Covid recovery to explore power dynamics and forms of exclusion in the labour market and workplaces. Findings of these studies can contribute to positive policy actions to prevent the exacerbation of existing socio-economic inequality and exclusion.

Recent scholarly claims suggest that talent management (TM) needs to move beyond assumptions and that TM research should address contextual factors. This study evaluated three assumptions of the TM literature entailing the intention to quit in a national context at the margins of Western culture. The salesforce of an international pharmaceutical company in Lima, Peru responded questions on the intention to quit and the Short Form of the Minnesota Job Satisfaction Questionnaire; then the data were analyzed comparing employees in vis-a-vis out of its elitist talent pool. Talented employees presented weaker quit intentions. This finding is consistent with theory and wide international evidence, as well as with a recent twist in the TM literature, and suggests that a fundamental TM relationship transcends national contexts. The other findings contradicted extended beliefs among TM theoreticians and practitioners, who expect a dominance of intrinsic vis-a-vis extrinsic satisfaction and an absence of gender differences in the turnover dynamics. Further research is required to establish whether these findings are specific to the Peruvian context or are robust and valid elsewhere, too.",art

Although some scholars have paid attention to the relationship between political skills and some dimensions of career success, few have explored a complete framework of career success and its relationship with political skills. In this study, the meta-analysis technique is used to integrate 141 studies containing 209 effect values (N = 57,406) from 2004 to 2020 to create a quantitative review of the relationship between political skills and career success. The results show that political skills are significantly correlated with career success, with a medium effect value (d = 0.289). Compared with objective career success (d = 0.256), political skills have a stronger predictive effect on subjective career success (d = 0.325). The moderating effect test finds that there are certain differences in the correlation between political skills and career success across different cultures, industries, and groups. The predictive effect of political skills on career success is higher in eastern than in western cultures, higher in the tertiary sector than in the secondary sector, and higher at the management level than at the employee level. This study explores the influence of political skills on career success and its dimensions and proposes management implications.

Today's world of work is forcing companies to change their approach to learning. Their talent strategy needs to foster self-directed learning (SDL) as a process. SDL is an instructional process in which people take the primary responsibility in learning situations. To enhance job performance, their talent strategy must also include tools that support effective competence development, such as personal development plans (PDPs). In this study, we consider the effectiveness of talent strategy of this nature, by analysing longitudinal data on 3,661 employees working in 16 countries, extracted from an electronic talent management system. Two path analyses were conducted to study the relationships between SDL exercised within a PDP practice and job performance, and to test the research hypotheses. Results validate the hypotheses, confirming that SDL as a process within PDP practice positively impacts job performance. However, while the results confirm the importance of setting learning goals and including informal learning activities when exercising SDL process within the PDP practice, they do not confirm the need to integrate other components of SDL as a process. It can be concluded that learning strategy is key to job performance, and that informal learning is of particular importance. Value-added recommendations for practice are discussed.",art

With the growing number of work-related mental health problems occurring worldwide, a call for all stakeholders to contribute to improving these problems has emerged. Managers' behaviors may act as a resource to promote the involvement of employees to foster mental health at work through their behaviors. This study aims to identify the behaviors of managers supporting the behaviors of employees fostering mental health at work. Following a qualitative research design, data were collected through interviews (n = 22) and analyzed using a template analysis strategy. The results reveal 20 concrete, specific and fairly simple behaviors that managers may adopt to support the involvement of their employees in behaviors fostering mental health at work. For example, consulting employees, providing room for mistakes and organizing social activities are behaviors managers may adopt to support the engagement of employees in behaviors fostering mental health at work. According to social exchange theory, the results of this study propose levers to implement a favorable context in which the behaviors of managers and those of employees interact. Given the potential influence of managers' behaviors on mental health at work, including this new knowledge in manager training would be judicious to foster shared responsibility for mental health at work.",art

Scholars, practitioners, and policymakers have long acknowledged the importance of understanding the antecedents of top management team (TMT) composition. Yet, research on how and why firms select executives who are demographically dissimilar to incumbent TMT members remains limited. We take a step toward answering these questions by employing a sample of 575 individual-level executive appointments at 170 large European firms between 2005 and 2009. Drawing on the person-group (P-G) fit perspective, we argue that firms are more likely to appoint socio-demographically dissimilar executives through internal promotion - while external hires are more likely to socio-demographically resemble incumbent top managers. Our results support the hypothesized relationship. They also show that this relationship is influenced by the level of administrative complexity and environmental uncertainty facing the firm. Overall, our theory and results enhance our understanding of why TMTs are composed the way they are, by highlighting the impact of internal and external hiring modes in the selection of demographically (dis)similar executives.",art

This study adopts a comparative institutionalist lens to explore contextual and temporal effects on the use of diversity action programmes within organisations across eight European countries. Using data from three rounds of the Cranet survey, we analyse the impact of market economy types and collective participation on diversity action programs over time. At the national level, we adopt a fourfold taxonomy of market economies transcending the typical LME/CME dichotomy to elucidate the nuanced complexities underlying temporal trends. Regarding diversity action programmes, we find a higher likelihood of their implementation in deregulated economies, compared to Scandinavian, Mediterranean and Rhineland economies. Over time, while deregulated economies tend to diverge from others, there are notably distinct patterns emerging in relation to Scandinavian economies, while comparisons with Rhineland and Mediterranean economies unveil patterns of both change and continuity. Furthermore, our findings indicate that collective participation enhances the adoption of diversity action programmes for most demographic groups. The relevant temporal analysis reveals that, largely, collective participation differentiates the organisational use of diversity action programmes over time.

We empirically examine this model using multi-wave and multi-source data collected from 246 hotel employee-supervisor dyads. We found that CFTP had a positive impact on strengths use for tasks and relationships, both of which were associated with increased in- and extra-role service performance. Furthermore, CFTP had a stronger relationship with strengths use for tasks and further service performance when work meaningfulness was high. CFTP was also closely associated with strengths use for relationships and subsequent service performance, regardless of the level of perceived task interdependence.

Based on the Conservation of Resources theory, this research investigates the association between work-family relationships and employees' well-being in teleworking situations, and explores the role of Family-Supportive Supervisor Behaviors (FSSB) as an important resource to help employees balance the exchange between work and life domains and improve well-being while teleworking. The current study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, when most organizations opted for telework and employees found themselves involuntarily working from home. We examined the intensity of remote work as a boundary condition to determine when FSSB can be a resource for employees in telework. Our research combines two studies: a cross-sectional study with 318 workers from a bank that implemented telework over seven months; and a two-wave study with 290 participants from another bank - time 1 was prior to lockdown and time 2 was ten months later. Moderated mediation hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling and the PROCESS macro for SPSS. Results from both studies show that FSSB is related to positive outcomes for work-family relationship and also for well-being. However, many of these associations are conditional upon the levels of intensity of telework. Implications for HRM theory and practice are discussed.",art

Employee referral programs that encourage employees to refer individuals from their social network for positions in their organization are an increasingly important HR practice. Previous research has mostly conceptualized employee referrals as beneficial acts towards the organization and provided evidence on factors that influence the likelihood of making an employee referral, but has largely disregarded the referrals' quality. Hence, previous findings on employee referrals might only apply to high quality referrals, but not to poor referrals, i.e. when employees knowingly refer candidates who are unmotivated or perform poorly. Building on social exchange theory, we therefore extend previous studies and focus on internal, prosocial, and external motives for employee referrals that can be conceptualized as counterproductive work behavior. We find a disturbingly high number of participants indicating that they would knowingly engage in a poor employee referral. In detail, we demonstrate that while affective organizational commitment is negatively related to the likelihood of making a poor employee referral, strong ties with the referral candidate and the presence of a monetary bonus are positively related. Furthermore, we investigate the cultural context of social exchange relationships; we find that in-group collectivism moderates the relationship between tie strength and the likelihood of poor referrals. Our study offers important implications for HR management theory and practice.",art

The paper uses the HRM-psychological wellbeing-performance mechanism to place journalists, a previously overlooked group in the literature as first responders, as the focal point of the HRM-wellbeing-performance discussion. Based on the Job demand-resource theory, job resources can buffer against challenging job demands, such as emotional labor that is peculiar to first responders' jobs. Our model examines the interacting effect of supervisor behavioral ambidexterity (SBA) and flexibility of human resource practices (HRPf) on the relationship between emotional regulation strategies and personal initiative-taking behavior from eustress- a good type of stress that carries a positive connotation for the employee experiencing it. A multisource two-wave survey amongst employees and supervisors from different organizations was used to explore the variables' empirical association. Results do not provide support for the moderating effect of HRPf (alone), even at high levels. However, the model showing the moderating effect of HRPf on the relationship between emotional regulation strategies and personal initiative-taking through eustress significantly improves at high levels of SBA, highlighting the linchpin role of SBA in the HRM-psychological wellbeing-performance relationship.",art

Relative to the large body of work in the broader strategic HRM (SHRM) literature, knowledge about determinants of SMEs' approaches to HRM remains limited. We argue that heterogeneity in the use of high performance work practices (HPWPs) is influenced by top managers' exposure and attention to information obtained via environmental scanning. Invoking an attention-based view (ABV), we develop hypotheses suggesting that competition tracking, participation in trade associations, and social network embeddedness will be associated with greater use of HPWPs. We also propose direct and moderating roles for top managers' perceptions of competitive intensity. We test our hypotheses using a database comprised of a combination of archival data and mail survey responses from 260 agricultural SMEs located in geographical clusters. Our results broadly support this study's hypotheses and contribute to a better understanding of the role of top managers' environmental scanning in the shaping of HPWPs in SMEs.",art

Psychological climate perceptions are related to important employee attitudes and behaviors, yet our knowledge of how such perceptions develop is relatively limited. Building upon work that has found that employees' interaction with coworkers influences similarity in employees' psychological climate perceptions, we focus on how network ties (advice, friendship) and their attributes (trust, expertise) are related to shared psychological climate perceptions. We use social information processing theory to argue that employees who have friendship and advice ties characterized by high levels of trust and expertise will have similar perceptions of the psychological climate. Using social network data from 61 employees in an information technology organization, we find that employees have psychological climate perceptions similar to those of friends whom they perceive to have high levels of trustworthiness and expertise, but not to those of low-trust or low-expertise friendship ties or advice ties. Our results challenge the notion that interaction in and of itself shapes psychological climate perceptions and instead suggest that certain ties with certain attributes are more important. In addition, we bring a sociological perspective into the highly 'psychologized' human resource management literature and contribute to social network research exploring social influence.",art

The impact of human resource management (HRM) practices on talent development and innovative work behaviour (IWB) has attracted considerable research attention in recent times, with the advent of knowledge economies. Drawing from the resource-based view of the firm, the aim of this research is to explore themes associated with talent development climate (TDC) and to test its role in promoting innovative work behaviour amongst managerial employees. The results of this research are based on three studies. Study 1 was qualitative that used an inductive approach, to explore the dimensions of TDC. Based on the themes that emerged from the qualitative study, we conducted studies 2 and 3 using quantitative methods on managers (N = 307 in first phase and N = 403 in second phase), drawn from 11 large global and Indian MNCs operating in India. The findings indicate two dimensions of TDC and highlight the mediating role of TDC in the relationship between HRM practices and IWB. The study contributes to the growing field of talent management with evidence from an emerging market economy - India. It provides a compelling argument for extending the scope of HRM practices and supervisory support in creating a talent development climate to achieve greater success in fostering innovation in organizations.",art

Research on labour disputes in China has primarily adopted a political economy perspective to focus on state-owned enterprises inland and foreign-invested plants in economically developed zones. Research has neglected community-based protests in small private firms in urbanising areas and their implications for human resource management and employment relations. This paper addresses this gap through an in-depth case study of a community-based, village cadres and clan leaders-led protest (including strike actions) against a privately-owned metal work factory located in a local community. Deploying the notion of community politics and 'acquaintance society', the study enriches our knowledge of industrial actions in China by extending the analytical scope of the context to understand the motive and choice of actions of individuals in participating in the disputes, and modes of dispute resolution. The study reveals the important role of social institutions and cultural norms, as well as the significance of discrete interventions of bureaucrats in the outcome of the dispute. We find that the settlement of community-based (labour) disputes may not officially involve key formal institutional actors, such as the trade union and legal/government authority. Rather, these institutional actors may be involved in an unofficial capacity, though drawing on power derived from their bureaucratic position in the intervention.",art

Globalization increases national culture and language diversity, which, if well managed, can benefit organizational performance. National culture is comprised of both language and country of origin, yet until relatively recently research has tended to focus on one or the other. We use person-organization fit theory and the meaning-based model of advertisement experience to propose that other-group orientation, a characteristic supportive of a pro-diversity climate, influences the relationship between language and national culture diversity recruiting messages and perceived person-organization fit. We used two randomized field experiments, one with 458 currently or recently employed people and one with 327 real job seekers, to test our model. Language and national culture diversity messages independently decreased perceived fit among those lower in other-group orientation and increased perceived fit among those higher in other-group orientation. A combined language and national cultural diversity message had the strongest effect by both decreasing fit perceptions among job seekers lower in other-group orientation and increasing fit perceptions among those higher in other-group orientation. These results refine both existing theory on and the practice of recruiting for pro-global diversity values by demonstrating that the relationship between recruiting message wording about an employer's pro-national culture and pro-language diversity values and person-organization fit is moderated by other-group orientation. These findings can help employers better understand how recruiting messages can play a strategic role in hiring pro-global diversity talent.",art

China's continued economic development relies heavily on its vibrant human resources, a large portion of which is accounted for by temporary agency workers (TAWs). However, researchers have yet to investigate the factors that are related to TAWs' retention in China. To address this research void, we take a contingency perspective on the relationship between TAW pay raise and voluntary turnover by examining the moderation effects of demographics on the relationship. Drawing on economic exchange theory and human capital theory, we reason that six identity-related demographic factors (namely hukou status, gender, age, education, tenure and occupation type) may alter the negative relationship between pay raise and voluntary turnover (hereafter referred to as turnover). Probit regression analyses of unbalanced panel data from 1184 TAWs over four years support the moderating effects of five of the six demographics (hukou, gender, age, education and tenure) on the negative pay raise - turnover link. The findings of this study provide important theoretical and practical insights for understanding TAWs' retention in China.",art

Employee entrepreneurship is an important and specific type of turnover behavior that is increasingly viewed as a significant challenge for human resource (HR) management practices in many organizations due to the lack of in-depth studies of turnover destinations in the current literature. By highlighting the heterogeneity of employee entrepreneurship and employee mobility, this study develops an integrative model to examine the double-edged sword effects of inducement HR practices on employee entrepreneurship through different dimensions of job embeddedness and the moderating effects of perceived institutional environment of entrepreneurship on these relationships. The results of two time-lagged studies reveal that, different from their negative impact on employee mobility, inducement HR practices positively impact employee entrepreneurship by enhancing the links and fit of employees and negatively impact employee entrepreneurship by increasing the sacrifice made by employees. Furthermore, the findings also demonstrate that the positive impact is stronger and that the negative impact is weaker when the institutional environment is perceived as favorable for entrepreneurship. The theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed.",art

The purpose of this article is to examine the availability of work-life balance (WLB) practices and the role of work-life balance supportive culture (WLBSC) in the retention of employees in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) through job satisfaction and organisational commitment. The organisations are increasingly conscious that the companies' competitive advantage rests upon the retention of their key employees. This study explores these relationships in SMEs with a sample of 290 employees from 134 companies of an industrial sector in Spain, using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM-PLS). The results reveal that the presence of a WLBSC is the principal determinant of job satisfaction, organisational commitment and reduced work-family conflict. In addition, there is strong evidence that job satisfaction and organisational commitment are strong determinants of turnover intentions. This article highlights the importance of the WLBSC and calls for organisational actions to develop a supportive culture to achieve a balance between work and personal life for their employees.",art

The normally low-risk and routinised nature of supermarket frontline work evolved drastically amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on a refined conceptual framework of extreme work, this article examines how the public health crisis coupled with maxinisation of organisational flexibility gives rise to extremity in mundane work settings. The findings based on 50 interviews with workers and managers who worked throughout the pandemic on the UK supermarket frontline offer empirical insights into the macro-micro dynamics of extreme-mundane work. These insights reveal a nuanced narrative of supermarket work as both alienating, owing to the frequent encounters of abuse and undervalued responsibilities, and fulfilling as a respite from social isolation induced by the pandemic. This narrative illustrates the complexities of individual motivations to engage with extreme work, while highlighting a need for structural support in coping with elevated exposure to risks and uncertainties. The article argues that the nature of work and workplaces in the face of extreme externalities remains contingent upon human resource management practices on the frontline of a crisis.",art

The demands of the workplace have become such that employees need to continuously change, tweak, and restructure the ways in which they work. To do so, they engage in a process called job crafting. This process is becoming so commonplace that it is crucial to verify whether organizations are able to provide a climate in which employees can feel positive about such changes. In this regard, positive leader-member exchange may create the conditions necessary to motivate employees to engage in job crafting behaviours against the contextual background of perceived organisational support. When employees are ready for change, they feel that they have the support of their organization, and experience high quality leader-member exchange, their engagement in job crafting behaviours will be heightened. Conducted through the lens of social exchange theory, our study represented an attempt to integrate some important predictors of job crafting behaviours-i.e. leader-member exchange, perceived organisational support, and the moderating role played by readiness to change. The study contributes to the literature by defining a model suited to revisit human resource (HR) practices and policies and to add value to the HR perspective to the end of improving organisational effectiveness.",art

This paper explores the diffusion of working hours standards beyond tier-1 suppliers in the garment supply chain. It compares working hours designs and rationales of tier-1 and tier-2 garment suppliers in Jordan and garment and textiles suppliers in Egypt. Building on the idea of crossvergence, the paper extends previous insights on explanatory factors that are rooted in the supply chain and captures global, local, and firm-level rationales. The analysis followed a flexible pattern matching logic and draws on a qualitative multiple-case study encompassing 30 owner-manager interviews, 13 expert interviews, and multiple documents and field observations. Convergence to global standards was found to be higher in tier-1 compared with tier-2 garment firms and differed between the garment and the textiles industry. The study showed that labour standard demands of global buyers dissolve along the supply chain, while the price and lead time squeeze persists or increases. How suppliers navigate the antagonism of labour standard and procurement demands depends upon local level factors and firm resources. A framework of human, intellectual, physical, and financial resources was developed to capture structural differences between higher- and lower-tier suppliers. The findings underscore the need for new procurement strategies of global buyers and tier-1 suppliers, and further investments in multi-stakeholder initiatives that monitor sub-suppliers, support resource development, and address systemic barriers to labour standard compliance.",art

Idiosyncratic deals (i-deals) are widespread in organizations, but their relationship to employees' work stress has been unclear. Based on the model of effort-reward imbalance (ERI), our study investigates this relationship and takes into account the role of social comparisons and denied i-deals. Two types of i-deals, flexibility i-deals and development i-deals, have been studied. We applied a time-lagged research design for which we collected data from 120 employees at two points in time to test our hypotheses. The results show that development i-deals significantly reduce employees' ERI, whereas flexibility i-deals do not relate to employees' ERI. Above that, the denial of i-deals increases ERI. Our results also show that social comparisons with co-workers' i-deals can influence the relationship between an employee's i-deals and his or her ERI. Hence, this study demonstrates that i-deals can affect employees' ERI, which may have diverse health-related and job-related consequences.",art

This study examines the change readiness for artificial intelligence (AI) adoption among human resource (HR) managers. In particular, it investigates the effects of the three elements of attitudes (cognitive, affective and behavioural elements) related to the HR managers' beliefs about AI, their AI anxiety, and their change readiness for AI adoption. The research also seeks to explore the moderating role of high-performance work systems (HPWS) in the relationships between HR -managers' beliefs, AI anxiety, and change readiness. Data were obtained from 417 HR managers working in China, with findings indicating that HR managers' beliefs about AI and their AI anxiety have a significant effect on their change readiness for AI adoption. Specifically, HR managers' beliefs positively influence their change readiness, while their AI anxiety negatively predicts their change readiness. Our results further highlight that HPWS can attenuate the -negative effect of AI anxiety on HR managers' change readiness for AI adoption. The study's theoretical and practical implications, limitations and directions for future research are also discussed accordingly.",art

With the advent of low-cost employment systems for pilots in commercial airlines, we address two questions: What are experienced UK-based, commercial airline pilots' perspectives on their current professional standing? What are their perspectives on current precarious employment in commercial airline piloting? Analysis of qualitative data from 28 pilots in commercial, passenger carrying airlines reveals declining professional standing and increasing precarious employment, alongside enduring aspects of professionalism. The corollary is that precarious professional employment is an emerging, pervasive type of low-cost employment system in the studied context. In terms of theoretical implications, our study highlights the need for exactness in understanding the complexities of declining professional standing and increasingly precarious employment. Our analysis offers an exact term, pilot-cariat, to encapsulate contemporary, UK-based and experienced commercial airline pilot employment. Further research may reveal more of what we call cariats in other occupations with responsibility for lives in similarly cost constrained and management agency contexts.",art

This review paper argues that e-HRM literature has not realised the full potential of different theoretical perspectives on information technology. This paper proposes one of them, a sociomaterial perspective, which recognises the equal importance of human agency and material artefacts in the formation and reproduction of e-HRM practices. The review juxtaposes existing perspectives within e-HRM literature with that of the sociomaterial perspective to illustrate the kinds of complementary theoretical and conceptual tools that can be applied to address current limitations in our understanding of the impact of e-HRM. A research agenda is presented that suggests ways to explore the materiality of technology, wider groups of actors and their agency, and emergent practices around technology. The application of this perspective means paying closer attention to how actions and material artefacts are intertwined and constitute 'doing HRM', which therefore requires thick descriptions of the organisational context and how work is performed in order to understand how technology matters, for whom and in what ways.",art

The current study developed and tested a mediation model that accounts for the procedural justice in the relationship between the perception of job insecurity and affect. We used a sample of 681 workers, from four private enterprises in the retail industry in Chile, who survived an organizational downsizing process. The hypotheses were tested by using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results indicated that the perception of job insecurity and employees' negative affects was partially mediated by procedural justice. However, the relationship between job insecurity and employees' positive affects was totally mediated by procedural justice. Therefore, such results suggest that it is important during a downsizing process for companies to implement actions to enhance job security in order to develop adequate affect among survivors. Furthermore, it is also seemingly crucial that justice should be an important issue in the downsizing process, and that the company should develop actions that reflect the perception of procedural justice throughout the process. Thus, this research provides evidence that it is useful to simultaneously consider procedural justice and stress reactions in a downsizing process, since neither are independent variables.",art

Acculturation is becoming an increasingly important and discussed topic in management research, with important implications for human resource management (HRM). However, although current managerial and organizational reviews include the concept of acculturation, little research has explored the concept of acculturation itself. Different perspectives on acculturation seem to exist, suggesting that the topic of acculturation has not grown uniformly in the field, and these differences have not been fully explored. This paper conducts an integrative review to examine the main perspectives of acculturation at the individual and organizational levels in management research, along with the strategic role HRM has played in them. Individual-level perspectives include a nonwork-cultural perspective, a work-cultural perspective, and a work-nonwork perspective. Organizational-level perspectives include a merger-fit perspective, a merger-integration perspective, an organizational-distance perspective, a diversity-management perspective, and an organizational-socialization perspective. We identify similarities, gaps, and limitations of research on acculturation at both the individual- and organizational-levels and discuss implications for future research.",art

The effects of family-friendly flexible working arrangements in organisations on the promotion of women to management positions-the case of Germany. Women are still significantly underrepresented in management positions, even though they have been able to increase their share to a small extent in recent years. Using arguments derived from signalling theory, this study examines whether organisational family-friendly flexible working arrangements (FFWAs) help to increase internal promotions of women to supervisory or managerial positions and thus reduce the existing gender leadership gap. This effect is investigated using longitudinal data for German workplaces and employees covering 1631 firms and 314,201 employees and fixed effects logistic regression models. The results demonstrate that the implementation of FFWAs improves the chances of internal promotions to supervisory or managerial positions for employees, with women and men benefiting equally. However, if I use a broader definition that also includes highly qualified specialist roles, implementing FFWAs can provide better promotion opportunities for women. Second, FFWAs increase the likelihood of being promoted to managerial positions with reduced working hours, and this effect is slightly stronger for men. Third, surprisingly, no significant positive effects of FFWAs were found on mothers' promotion of managerial positions. These results show that, even with organisational support, it remains difficult for women to reach management positions and combine family and career at the same time.",art

Although the literature on psychological contracts is rich, researchers have so far paid limited attention to psychological contracts in times of crisis. To investigate how employees assess their psychological contracts during a crisis, we conducted 32 semistructured interviews during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. The interviewees worked in the airline industry, which the pandemic severely affected. Our qualitative approach allowed us to gain novel insights into the mechanisms by which contracts are managed when the typical parameters of contract assessment are not possible, thereby allowing us to expand psychological contract theory. In addition to illustrating the key employer obligations that employees perceived during a crisis, we introduce two novel theoretical concepts -psychological contract credit and psychological contract inactivation - that explain how employees managed their contracts during the crisis. The practical findings of this study are of relevance to HR managers in managing future crises and addressing the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.",art

As the digitalization of Human Resource Management (HRM) has been going on for more than half a century the performance and, thus, the future continuance and intensification of digital HRM is regularly taken for granted. While there is a growing and increasingly unmanageable number of research contributions on the performance consequences of digital HRM, core reviews fail to offer consistent and convincing evidence on digital HRM performance. Current sentiments and implementations are based on implicit expectations rather than on explicit evidence. To provide the future digitalization of HRM with the necessary evidence, we conduct a meta-analysis on the performance consequences of digital HRM. Concretely, we analyze the performance of individual users, the operational, relational, and transformational performance of HRM, and the corporate performance of the entire organization. Based on evidence from 96 empirical studies with a total sample size of 37,924, our meta-analysis finds significant medium-sized associations between digital HRM and all performance categories. We also resolve the partially contradictory findings, quantify and compare performance effects, and uncover moderating effects.

Self-initiative expatriates (SIEs) are increasingly important to the global talent pool. However, they are vulnerable to identity strain due to their self-initiative status and tendency to maintain their previous identity during temporary stays in the host country. Drawing on conservation of resources theory, we establish a resource-based model to examine the indirect effects of SIEs' identity strain on expatriate outcomes (performance, work withdrawal, repatriation intention) through on-the-job and off-the-job embeddedness, with off-the-job relationship building as the boundary condition. With a two-wave research design, we collected data from 103 Chinese visiting scholars at 48 American universities in 2017. The results show that identity strain has indirect effects on all three expatriate outcomes through on-the-job embeddedness and an indirect effect on repatriation intention through off-the-job embeddedness. Off-the-job relationship building buffers the indirect effects of identity strain on expatriate outcomes via on-the-job embeddedness rather than off-the-job embeddedness.",art

The antecedents and outcomes of teacher burnout have received increasing research attention in China over the last three decades, as burnout becomes a serious issue for a large workgroup of 1.6 million teachers in Chinese education system. However, there has been no comprehensive review to synthesize the literature in this area, limiting our understanding on how burnout is experienced in this specific culture context. In this paper, using job demands-resources (JD-R) model as a theoretical framework, we conduct an integrative literature review on teacher burnout in China, which includes 67 studies published from 1995 to the present. We review on the job demands, job resources, personal resources as the antecedents of burnout, and also on the outcomes of burnout. Our review indicates that teachers in China experience unique job demands because of specific cultural context. Moreover, we summarize how proactive and avoidant coping contribute differently to the mechanism of burnout development among Chinese teachers. Third, drawing from the recent extension of the JD-R model, we build a conceptualized framework to suggest future avenues for teacher burnout research in China, including examining job demands, job resources, and personal resources under specific cultural context, further investigating the role of coping strategies in the JD-R model, and conducting more research on intervention.",art

This paper aims to extend the understanding of how so-called bridge individuals in multinational corporations (MNCs) engage multiple languages to mediate the transfer of human resource management (HRM) practices between headquarters and subsidiaries. Adopting a case study of foreign subsidiaries of a single Japanese MNC (in Thailand, Belgium and the US), the findings identify three main kinds of multilingual mediators: enabler, blocker and selector individuals. While enablers utilize multiple languages as a tool kit to support home country-based HRM practices, blockers leverage language disparities to hinder those practices, bringing about, what this paper refers to as a curtain effect. Selectors, meanwhile, utilize the corporate language, English, as a lingua franca to partially enable those practices, as well as occasionally to block them. Understanding how language integrates with these mediation functions serves to illustrate the complexity of bridge individuals and boundary spanners. Furthermore, the findings reveal the close association between these mediating functions and multilingual mediators' perceptions and understandings of the institutional cultural contexts in the subsidiary, something that has so far rarely been discussed in the literature. Moreover, the findings reiterate the importance of local contextual influences on how language acts as a source of power in foreign subsidiaries.",art

Although research has shown that HRM can contribute to innovation, only limited scholarly attention has been given to the bottom-up emergence of innovation based on an employees' ideas. Furthermore, while scholars have accumulated knowledge about innovative behavior in business contexts where innovation is nurtured, to fully understand 'innovation by employees' we need to also address business contexts where innovation by employees is not overtly expected. For these reasons, the aim of this paper is to explore the bottom-up emergence of so-called employee-driven innovation (EDI) in a formalized business context and study how HRM support mechanisms contribute to this. We conducted an explorative single case study in a highly formalized company - a medical laboratory in the Netherlands. The data analysis was based on 40 interviews, documents, and observations. We found that a highly formalized business context does support innovation by employees, but that this has specific employee-driven innovation routes through which employees innovate. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the content and process of EDI emergence should be studied using a multilevel perspective. We offer recommendations on how EDI routes should be modelled and reflect on what this contributes to the HRM - innovation literature.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/09585192.2021.1913625 .",art

The study introduces three forms of employee participation in decision making in SMEs (work role, HR, and strategic) and tests two competing hypotheses regarding their positive and negative relationships with one aspect of employee wellbeing, namely job satisfaction. It further explores if one internal boundary condition - firms' exploitation and exploration - moderates the three participation-satisfaction relationships. Using multilevel data collected from top managers and employees in Swedish SMEs, the results support positive connotations of participation, with work role participation having the strongest relationship with employee job satisfaction. The results additionally highlight the role of firms' explorative orientation as an internal boundary condition for the three participation-satisfaction relationships. Specifically, the positive relationships of work role and strategic participation forms with job satisfaction were stronger under high levels of exploration. Surprisingly, participation in HR issues related negatively to satisfaction under the same conditions. The study advances HRM-SME research by discussing these findings, highlighting their implications for practitioners in SMEs, and proposing avenues for future research.",art

Drawing from socioanalytic theory and intergroup contact hypothesis, this study investigates the relationship across self-initiated expatriates' (SIEs') multicultural personality traits and host country nationals' (HCNs') satisfaction with SIE performance in China. Findings based on dyadic matched data from 101 SIEs and HCN co-workers suggest that four of the multicultural personality traits (cultural empathy, flexibility, social initiative, emotional stability) are positively related to HCNs' satisfaction with SIE performance. Only SIEs' open-mindedness did not exert an influence on HCNs' satisfaction with SIE performance. Furthermore, frequency of interaction between the SIE and their HCN co-worker moderated the relation between two of the multicultural personality traits (cultural empathy, emotional stability) and the outcome variable. Analyses imply that if frequency of interaction is low, cultural empathy and emotional stability exert a stronger influence on HCNs' satisfaction with SIE performance. Our findings contribute to the existing literature by providing deeper insights into the dynamics of expatriate personality and working conditions and how they inform HCNs' satisfaction with SIE performance.",art

In an effort to extend workplace accountability research, our studies identify an actor that is accountable for the mistreatment of an understudied group of employees: Black employees. We accomplish this by leveraging insights from the attributions of accountability and anti-Black racism literatures. Subsequently, we adopt an overall socio-psychological perspective and integrate social cognitive and organizational resentment theories to explain why organizational leaders that are perceived to support anti-Black sentiments are more likely to mistreat Black employees. Across three studies, we find that supervisors perceived to be Trump-supporting, in comparison to those perceived to be Trump-opposing, are more likely to display abusive supervision toward Black employees. In turn, as Black employees experience abusive supervision, they develop organizational resentment as they attribute this mistreatment to their employer. We also find that the impact of abusive supervision on organizational resentment is weaker when Black employees' organization-based self-esteem (OBSE) is relatively low compared to relatively high. This is because Black employees with relatively low OBSE are more likely to blame themselves for the abuse. Theoretical contributions, practical implications, limitations, and future research are discussed.",art

Building on the emerging research on antecedents of social undermining, we develop and test a threat-based tripartite model of social undermining that outlines why and when employees may engage in social undermining in the workplace. Specifically, we draw on the transactional theory of stress to suggest that task conflict, as a contextual factor, serves as a fundamental stressor that provokes social undermining. Within this transactional stress framework, we also argue that task conflict is more likely to provoke social undermining under conditions of higher levels of abusive supervision (context) and openness to experience (personality) simultaneously. In this regard, we propose a three-way interaction suggesting that task conflict, abusive supervision, and openness to experience jointly interact to predict higher levels of social undermining. Our findings from two separate field investigations using time-lagged, multisource data (i.e. employee-coworker dyads) provide general support for our hypothesized model. Research and practical implications for human resource management, as well as recommendations for future research, are discussed.",art

Since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, there has been a wealth of studies and reports published on the impacts of remote working (or work-from-home) due to pandemic lockdown measures. The primary aim of this article is to synthesise this work and conduct an exploratory scoping review of both scholarly and grey literature on the impacts of the pandemic on people, productivity, and the planet, with a focus on remote working (or work-from-home) and the post-pandemic workplace. Further, in light of the wide range of terms such as work-from-home, remote working, hybrid working, teleworking, telecommuting, and work-from-anywhere, a secondary but necessary aim of this scoping review is to clarify these terms before reviewing the extant literature on the multi-level impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. A review of this literature revealed that most of the scholarly research and industry reports published since the pandemic outbreak are data-driven and some anecdotal rather than theory-driven. The common themes and findings backed by evidence include the gendered division of labour, organisational trust and managerial trust in employees, changes in workforce management, virtual communication and collaboration, reduced carbon emissions, and increased plastic consumption. The scoping review concludes by discussing the post-pandemic workplace and a brief research agenda.",art

In this annual editorial for The International Journal of Human Resource Management, we project a vision of a sustainable ecosystem of human resource management (HRM) research by reflecting on key trends of HRM research and provide suggestions for future research efforts for the HRM research community. We outline the evolution and development of six areas of HRM research that are highly relevant to the policy and practice in the current global political-economic context. These research pursuits are shifting from firm-oriented and technology-oriented to becoming more employee-oriented and society-oriented. We extend these lines of enquiry with suggestions of what future research can examine to keep pace with practice and to offer policy and practical recommendations.

In this article, we examine how collective creative self-efficacy (CCSE) of a team can act as a competency indicator for team creativity output (TCO) in knowledge-intensive SMEs. As a team's creative efficacy shape the collective mental model about its social context, team climate of creativity is considered as a mediator in the relationship between CCSE and TCO. Through faultline-strength analysis, we investigate how team members' compositional attributes (age and job tenure) moderate the relationship between CCSE and team climate. A High sub-group separation (age and job tenure attributes) of team members is beneficial in a high CCSE team, whereas a homogeneity in age and tenure is desirable when a team's CCSE is low. Our results show group faultline-strength can significantly strengthen or dampen the existing team climate and team creativity output within SMEs, thus creating a strong basis for firm owners or managers to align teams for improved team output. Moreover, HRs in such firms can design interventions to measure and enhance teams'collective creative self-efficacy of a team that serve two purposes-a) act as a competency indicator that guides a team to become self-directed, and, b) strengthen the team creativity climate for producing creative deliverables.",art
10.1080/09585192.2021.1965007,"What drives firms to invest in training and developing employees? Time-dependent effects of firm internal and external contingencies. Drawing on the cost-value framework, the present study identifies internal and external firm-specific factors as predictors and firm performance as a contingency to explain the level and temporal growth of firm investment in training and development (T&D) over time. The theoretical propositions are empirically validated by analyzing multisource longitudinal data from 172 firms over a period of three years. The analysis shows that human capital quality and technology change are positive predictors of the level of T&D investment. The growth curve analysis demonstrates that high-performing firms increase T&D investment when they are managed by professional managers and possess high-quality human capital. By contrast, low-performing firms decrease T&D investment when they are controlled by owners, possess low-quality human capital, and operate under low technology change. The current analysis offers intriguing insights into how firms with differing internal and external situations allocate resources to T&D and increase or decrease their T&D investment over time depending on their performance and resulting financial slack. The current investigation on the temporal trajectories of T&D investment under distinct firm-specific situations and contingencies considerably expands the existing literature based on cross-sectional static perspectives.",art

Employee wellbeing is vital for their job satisfaction and motivation to achieve the long-term goals of their employers. Organisations provide flexible work arrangements (FWAs) as one of the strategies for attending to employee wellbeing. Despite the motivating role of FWAs, their links with firm level innovation are rarely considered. This study examines the relationships between FWAs and innovation. It also investigates how the competitive environment in which firms operate moderates the FWA-innovation relationship. Drawing upon a rich longitudinal data of 1513 Australian SMEs, our findings suggest that provision of flexitime and flexi-leave encourage innovation as they provide the mental space and diversity needed for knowledge creation, sharing and exploitation. Moreover, high market competition has limited effect on the positive associations between flexitime and flexi-leave, as FWAs, and innovation but attenuates the relationship between job-sharing and innovation. Our findings imply that SME managers should prioritize the provisions of flexitime and flexi-leave to their employees as these FWAs have pronounced effects on firm-level innovation.",art

Increased levels of female labour market participation have impacted on the ability of families to provide care for elderly relatives in many industrialised societies. While work-family balance has received significant academic attention, less attention has focused specifically on individuals with eldercare responsibility, a cohort which accounts for a growing segment of the labour market internationally. Taking a qualitative research approach this paper uses work/family border theory to the constraints and facilitators to reconciling care and employment for employees working full-time in Ireland. The findings highlight the significant impact that eldercare provision has on employees with regard to day-to-day work commitments. We find that while general work-life balance policies exist within organisations, that the design and functionality of such policies are of limited value to elder caregivers. Furthermore, this paper highlights how the lack of formal HR policies around eldercare within organisations results in a reliance on supervisory discretion. We make some recommendations for organisational level strategies to address the needs of a growing number of caregivers.",art

Research on the 'new career' has explored some individual correlates of protean and boundaryless career orientations while largely neglecting their consequences for organizations. Our paper addresses this omission by exploring the link between 'new career' orientations and both positive and negative extra-role behaviours based on the argument that these dimensions of performance are potentially more variable given their volitional nature. In addition, it explores the role of organizational commitment and perceived organizational support in shaping this relationship. We present the results of a study with 641 employee-supervisor dyads in nineteen organizations showing that a protean career orientation results in more positive extra-role behaviours, whereas a boundaryless career orientation is associated with less citizenship behaviour and higher deviant behaviour due to its negative impact on commitment. In addition, our findings suggest that organizations can positively influence the behaviour of individuals with high boundaryless career orientations by offering high levels of support.",art

Numerous studies have explored the situations of gig workers in the 'new' gig economy. While the existing literature focuses on intermediary platforms' algorithmic control over workers, this paper emphasizes the interpersonal and negotiable aspects of gig worker-customer interactions through an accountability perspective. We posit that algorithmic control and accountability to customers constitute two coordination mechanisms for platform HRM. The latter has gained significance as intermediary platforms adopt algorithmic management and empower customers as visible supervisors. Algorithm-mediated customer control assigns customers direct influence, thereby positioning them as prominent accountability sources and compelling gig workers to meet their expectations. Nevertheless, how gig workers navigate their behaviors under these conditions remains unknown. This study employs a typological approach to explore gig workers' coping strategies in response to accountabilities, providing micro-level insights into the functionality and dysfunctionality of HRM with gig platforms. Drawing from a qualitative study in the Chinese online delivery industry, we integrate metaphors from cognitive research (i.e. intuitive psychologists and intuitive economists) with the metaphor derived from accountability theory (i.e. intuitive politicians) to develop a fourfold typology grounded in two dimensions (i.e. cognitive modes and economic motives). Our findings reveal both the inevitability and possibility of accountability to customers, identifying four coping strategies (i.e. obedient, ingratiatory, defensive, and cooperative behaviors). This paper offers novel insights into the fields of accountability and HRM research, along with practical implications.",art

The chief human resource officer (CHRO) role elevates people-related matters to the apex of the firm. Why do some companies' leading management teams place so much emphasis on human resources while others do not? The present study argues that CHROs' presence in the C-suite is driven by firms' imitation of industry peers' leadership structures as a response to uncertainty. The investigation also sheds light on the moderating role of environmental factors that can influence mimetic isomorphism in HR leadership. Through a longitudinal analysis of large listed firms between 2006 and 2020, the study shows a positive relationship between the prevalence of the CHRO position among firms' peers and a focal firm having a CHRO in its top management. The results demonstrate that certain types of uncertainty serve as boundary conditions for such copying actions: Industry growth strengthens mimicking behavior while industry dynamism weakens it. There is no clear evidence for the moderating role of industry competition. The findings contribute a neo-institutional view of human resource structures in the top management and strengthen the bond between the strategy and human resource literature.",art

This study examines the effects of an autonomy-supportive climate on employee satisfaction and organizational performance at the organizational level. It also extends self-determination theory by applying this theory to the differential interaction effects of individual and group incentives with an autonomy-supportive climate on employee satisfaction and organizational performance. Employees may differently utilize autonomy granted to them depending on whether or not they are granted financial incentives and depending on the type of financial incentives granted to them, if any. The hypotheses were tested by moderated mediation models using nationally representative panel data that were collected from 2009 to 2015. The moderation analyses provide evidence that while individual incentives strengthened the effect of an autonomy-supportive climate on employee satisfaction, group incentives weakened that effect. Furthermore, individual incentives resulted in little change to the effect of an autonomy-supportive climate on organizational performance, but group incentives strengthened that effect. Since the results do not identify specific best practices for the combination of an autonomy-supportive climate and financial incentives, this study implies that top management should make strategic choices with regard to which combination of practices they adopt among less or more autonomy-supportive practices and individual or group incentives.",art

The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a massive adoption of high-intensity work-from-home (WFH), a form of work organization that is expected to persist. Yet, little is known about the predictors and mechanisms underlying employees' successful adjustment to high-intensity WFH. Drawing on signaling theory, we identify psychological climate for face time (i.e., an employee's perception that their organization values physical presence in the office) as an antecedent of WFH adjustment. We argue that when WFH employees perceive that their organization encourages face time, they may view availability as a signal of their dedication to work, replacing visibility. Consequently, they feel expected to be extensively available (e.g., check emails outside of regular working hours). In turn, these perceived expectations predict lower adjustment to WFH. We further explore whether this process differs in the US and two European countries, France and Spain, given different employment protection and right to disconnect legislations, and different meanings attached to work ethics. In a two-wave study on a sample of 532 full-time WFH employees, structural equation modeling analyses show that perceptions of availability expectations mediate the negative relationship between psychological climate for face time and WFH adjustment, and that this process is accentuated in the US.",art

Our study aimed to investigate if and what configuration of characteristics exists to enable MNEs to develop an effective talent management strategy of key local stakeholders for broader economic, social and environmental value creation, supported by the strategic HR management literature. We performed a fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis of 20 training projects addressed to local key stakeholders in various industries and emerging countries.

Despite the wide use of social media in the workplace, only limited research has addressed how social media use at work would influence employees' work and affective outcomes. Building upon the self-regulatory perspective, the current study proposes that social media use at work will induce interruptions and procrastination, which in turn will reduce employees' work engagement; individuals then will show the feeling of guilt because of decreased work engagement. This study examines the proposed theoretical model with an experience sample methodology (ESM), moving beyond predominant between-person designs in the social media use literature. 155 full-time employees were recruited and asked to report their daily experiences for ten consecutive workdays, finally resulting in 1165 data points at the within-person level. Results showed that daily social media use at work exerted a negative indirect effect on work engagement via procrastination, and it also had a positive indirect effect on guilt via interruption and procrastination. This study helps to elucidate the underlying mechanisms between social media use at work and employee outcomes, as well as enriching the literature by examining guilt as the psychological cost of using social media in the workplace.",art

Using matched data between firm ERS and financial performance across 18 years, we find support for the dual-causal relationship between firm ERS and Tobin's Q. We also find that the impact of firm ERS on Tobin's Q loses its significance over time, whereas the impact of Tobin's Q on ERS largely remains stable over time. Lastly, we find that firm resource availability makes the positive impact of firm ERS on financial performance (Tobin's Q and net income per employee) stronger and longer lasting.",art

With low barriers to entry and ease of access to work, the gig economy offers the prospect of boundaryless opportunities for flexible working arrangements characterised by increased autonomy. This form of work, however, may leave individuals without development opportunities and could stymie career progression. Drawing on boundaryless career theory, this study examines the potential of gig workers to develop the transferable career competencies required to effectively pursue opportunities beyond these precarious roles. Through insights from 56 gig worker interviews, we analyse the lived experiences of workers in attempting to develop 'knowing-why', 'knowing-how', and 'knowing-whom' competencies. In so doing, we find that the potentially unmovable boundaries posed by algorithmic management practices within platform organisations constrains workers' abilities to navigate their roles and develop transferable competencies. The study lends empirical support to the bounded effect of gig work on individuals' careers in a domain characterised by precarity where organisations dismiss the existence of an employment relationship, where individuals may simultaneously work for multiple platforms, and where secretive algorithms heavily influence the experience of work.",art

Using three-wave survey data, we theoretically developed and empirically tested a dual-process model that specifies how voice endorsement is associated with the characteristics of employees and with the psychological processes of managers. Our findings suggest that proactive personality and task performance and of employees are positively associated with voice endorsement of managers. Meanwhile, managers' affect-based trust and cognition-based mediate these two relationships. We aim to contribute to the voice literature and provide practical implications to both employees and managers when giving and receiving voices.",art

This study draws on relative deprivation theory to investigate the effect of career derailment upon return from an international assignment on repatriate retention, thereby also considering factors which can mitigate this relationship. The results from a hierarchical linear regression analysis of data from 292 repatriates indicate that career derailment upon repatriation decreases the former expatriates' intent to stay. However, this effect is weaker when individuals perceived that they had promotion, autonomy and compensation advantages relative to colleagues who lack international assignment experience and when they were provided organizational repatriation support by their assigning organization. With these findings, this work lays the ground for strategies to improve the retention of former expatriates despite restricted career opportunities in the home organization. Thereby, it helps firms to realize the long-term benefits of international assignments.",art

With a significant proportion of college students in many countries engaging in risky drinking behavior, this study examines the tendency of such young adults to 'mature out' of such behavior in their first year of employment after graduating, and the degree to which three mainstream organizational on-boarding experiences may expedite such 'maturing out'. Focusing on newcomers' experiences with alcohol-oriented job orientation, job empowerment, and organizational efforts to facilitate the development of supportive peer relationships, we test hypotheses regarding the direct effects of time on the change in alcohol misuse among those reporting misuse in college, as well as the degree to which individual on-boarding experiences account for the variance in young adults' maturing out trajectories over the course of their first year of employment. Findings generated from data collected from over 400 young adults over multiple waves offer important theoretical and practical implications regarding how and why particular onboarding tactics may be more or less effective in influencing newcomers' health-related behaviors.",art

This study aims to understand how extreme working conditions, work intensification, and employee well-being are related in the context of dirty work. We conducted a grounded theory study through interviews with 57 workers in so called 'dirty jobs' who are tasked with cutting off electricity in Brazilian favelas. Our model showed that, when working in extreme conditions, dirty workers seek to build more positive meanings in relation to their professional occupation as a way of collectively reacting to the negative judgments they receive. This process leads them to identify more with their work role, to work more intensely, and to experience a sense of well-being at work. With that, they also accept and even want to continue to work in extreme conditions. However, when workers experience situations in which their sense of self is threatened, they reject being subjected to extreme working conditions and limit the intensity of their work.",art

Supervisor control behavior and support behavior have each been shown to be associated with telecommuter work outcomes. Based on Job Demands-Resources model, we tested the joint effects of these supervisor behaviors in predicting telecommuters' self-regulation at work and subsequent work outcomes (task performance and helping behavior). Full-time telecommuters (N = 303) completed online questionnaires about their work situation. Results of polynomial regression analyses supported the hypothesized mediation model. Telecommuters reported higher self-regulation at work and better work outcomes when supervisors showed high congruence in control and support, compared to those whose supervisors showed low congruence in their behavior. Further, when there was incongruence in supervisor behaviors, telecommuters' outcomes were better when supervisor support was higher than control than when control was higher than support. Our findings have theoretical and practical implications for how to be an effective remote leader in Times of Crisis like COVID-19. Limitations and future directions are discussed.",art

The paper does not attempt to minimize these practical difficulties, but nevertheless suggests new ways forward for time-based careers research. First, we review the reasons for time playing such a central role in the study of careers. Next, we examine the approach scholars from other disciplines, ranging from philosophy to organization studies, have taken to the study of time, drawing out a number of anchor points that, we suggest, form the basis for a new research agenda for career studies. Finally, we develop idea for this agenda across three broad themes, to do with conceptual issues, methodological issues, and areas of study that could fruitfully be opened up.",art

In recent years, employee voice has become a popular topic in organizational behavior research. However, existing research has failed to explore when and how ambidextrous leadership influences voice. Adopting leader-member exchange theory and person-environment fit theory, we constructed a moderated mediation model and analyzed the influential path and boundary of ambidextrous leadership on employee voice on the basis of gender similarity between leaders and subordinates. To test our conceptual model, we collected sample in three phases at a monthly interval from multiple employees and their direct leaders from China. Drawing on a paired questionnaire survey of 43 leaders and 182 subordinates, we tested our conceptual model by using polynomial regression analysis, hierarchical regression, and bootstrapping methods. Results reveal that (1) ambidextrous leadership has a positive effect on employee voice; (2) employee emotional expression plays a mediating role in the relationship between ambidextrous leadership and voice; (3) when the gender between leaders and subordinates is different, the mediating effect of emotional expression is strong.

This study's goal is to understand repatriates' personal experiences about their career success motives in the years following an international assignment and how that may prompt turnover intentions. The case study comprises data from 8 Portuguese companies belonging to different industries. Overall, we interviewed 42 repatriates and 17 human resource organizational representatives. Building on career success literature, this study's findings show that these repatriates' main career-pull motives to stay with the organization are related to (1) Recognition and Affection, (2) Financial and Employment Security, (3) Developmental Career Opportunities, (4) and, lastly, Career Advancement. By comparison, these repatriates' career-push motives to leave pertain to (1) the Lack of Developmental Career Opportunities, (2) Financial and Employment Insecurity, and (3) Recognition and Affection Breach. Furthermore, the findings shed new light on the role played by contextual-structural career boundaries as a mitigating factor in repatriates' turnover intentions.

RL may thus facilitate adjustment and well-being in the host country. We emphasize the support potential when expatriates' supervisors are guided by a strong values foundation and exhibit stakeholder engagement. In this way, we aim to provide a perspective for studying leadership dynamics in the expatriation context that goes beyond leader-follower dyads within organizations.

Ulrich's framework of the human resource business partner model (HRBPM) suggests that both the strategic HRM roles (i.e. strategic partner and change agent) and operational HRM roles (i.e. administrative expert and employee champion) jointly add value to an organization. To deepen our understanding of the link between the HRBPM and organizational performance, this study jointly examines the influence of strategic and operational roles on organizational performance and introduces internal efficiency as a central mediating mechanism that explains how the HRBPM contributes to organizational success. In addition, we offer an institutional perspective on the HRBPM to improve our understanding of how the HRBPM is designed in different institutional contexts and whether the performance implications depend on the organization's institutional environment. Based on data from 300 medium-sized and large organizations from Germany and the UK, we found a joint impact of the HRM roles on organizational performance, mediated by internal efficiency. We also found differences in the design of the HRBPM between the UK and Germany; however, we did not find a moderated mediation for the country comparison concerning the performance implications of the HRBPM.

Using grounded theory, we interviewed 34 top managers to understand how they define talent and how they manage such talent. The research highlights the crucial role of social values in this context. It generates a perspective on the definition of talent that differs from that of the traditional TM literature. The variety of talent definitions creates the following three different paths for TM: community-based, innovation and learning-based, and security and status-based. Then, we derive from these paths three patterns of TM practices (managerial, entrepreneurial and amateur) that describe the TM practices among Russian MDOs. This study contributes to the TM literature by challenging the traditional approach to TM that focuses on large private companies in Western countries. This paper links TM with social and moral values and presents three different TM patterns, which might be helpful for CEOs, executives and TM managers.",art

An earlier special issue of this journal (Vol. 25, Issue 21, 2014), focused on the use of the lean model in developed countries. The authors of the introductory article (Bamber, Stanton, Bartram and Ballardie, 2014, pp. 2881-2891) observed that lean in an employment relations-unionist paradigm is relatively an under researched area, despite several organizations attempting to introduce lean being unionized. Resultantly, two broad themes they identified for further research, included the relationship between lean and employee unions, and the involvement of unions in the implementation of lean. This article addresses these themes by paying attention to an actual case study of the attempts made by the Japanese automotive giant Toyota, to establish its customized lean model within its unionized Australian affiliate TMCA (Toyota Motor Corporation Australia), during the period 1959-2015. The findings suggest that there is an acrimonious relationship between lean and the unions - as evidenced by Australia's strong manufacturing unions that posed significant challenges to Toyota's efficacious implementation of lean practices - and concur with a few of the key reasons that informed the decision taken by the company's top management in 2014 to cease their Australian manufacturing operations by 2017.",art

Using the dynamic skill, neo-human capital and AI job replacement theories, we contend that the introduction and adoption of AI calls for employees to upskill themselves. To determine the key skills deemed critical for the upskilling of employees, we interviewed 20 experienced professionals in multinational corporations (MNCs) in the information technology sector in India. Deploying Gioia's methodology for qualitative analysis, our investigation revealed five critical skills for employee upskilling: data analysis, digital, complex cognitive, decision making and continuous learning skills.",art

Given the increasing application of cutback strategies in the workplace, and an underlying need to understand explanatory process at work, we investigated the effects of one cutback strategy to deal with economic uncertainty - furloughs. Equity theory and social exchange theory guided our predictions in explaining the mechanisms through which furloughs affect turnover intentions. Quantitative data collected at two time periods during the Great Recession, after cutbacks were announced and implemented, provided evidence that assessments of psychological contract breach and work overload affect the relationship between furlough experience and turnover intentions. To investigate how the additional stressors of a pandemic affected the proposed model, a follow-up content analysis of employee discussions around cutback policies during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted. This analysis provided support for the model, and also identifies several additional themes brought on by the pandemic (trust, and health and safety), with many employees exhibiting feelings of anxiety and fear around cutback policies and the status of their employment in general. Our results have implications for many organizational cutback initiatives, including salary reductions and decreased organizational resources, that are implemented during times of crisis.",art

It is now widely recognised that a 'good' diversity management (DM) is crucial for promoting organisational innovation and well-being. However, recent evidence shows diversity management (DM) often doesn't guarantee the desired results. We assumed DM could be hindered when the underlying organisational culture of difference (OCD) does not authentically legitimise diversity. Thus, OCD is the sediment of the organisational assumption about diversity that defines dynamics at a deep level and determines the everyday 'field' into which all DM proposals 'land'. Assuming that only an OCD that authentically recognises diversity as an intrinsic worth can provide a positive impact through DM, we investigated the impact that different OCDs can have on the organisational quality of life. A total of 3.247 questionnaires were collected. Data were analysed in aggregate form using ANOVA and MANOVA through SPSS. Results supported our assumption: OCDs have a statistically significant impact on organisational quality of life; specifically, the 'diversity-driven' OCD has the most significant impact in promoting participation, innovation, commitment, and well-being. We conclude by discussing theoretical and practical implications, highlighting that when not adequately contextualised and supported by the OCD, DM may exacerbate the idea of diversity as an organisational disadvantage.",art

Finding ways to motivate employees to speak up with suggestions and concerns is an important organizational concern. Drawing on the proactive motivation model, this research examines how organizational reward practices can encourage employee voice. We investigate whether tangible rewards (e.g. bonuses, pay increases, promotion) and intangible rewards (e.g. recognition, praise, positive feedback) can facilitate employee voice through the respective effects on employee psychological safety and organizational identification. Using three experiments across three different organizational and cultural contexts, we find consistent results supporting our hypotheses. Our three studies included working adults from the following regions: China (278 participants), United Kingdom (282 participants) and United States (272 participants). We conclude that employees make attributions about organizational reward practices whereby rewards signal to employees it is safe to voice and employees are valued. Our research demonstrates that both tangible and intangible rewards have indirect effects on employee voice by enhancing psychological safety, activating the 'can do' motivation process to voice, and by increasing their organizational identification that triggers the 'reason to' motivation process. We provide practical recommendations for organizations concerning how to use reward practices to best optimise psychological safety and organizational identification to encourage voice and suggest future research directions.",art

Multinational enterprises (MNEs) have increasingly expanded worldwide, so they need to recruit talent abroad. Nevertheless, the extant recruitment literature lacks an international perspective, as most research has been conducted in a single country context and in developed countries, creating a gap regarding how MNEs can develop optimal international recruiting strategies, considering not only developed but also emerging countries. Based on a cross-national conjoint analysis in an emerging country (Vietnam) and a developed country (the US), we calibrate the relative importance of organizational/job attributes, especially those with symbolic value such as MNEs' country-of-origin (emerging vs. developed) and the three dimensions of CSR (economic, social and environmental responsibilities), together with other instrumental factors (e.g. pay, career opportunities), to young applicants in the two countries. Our results reveal some differences. Applicants from an emerging market attach more value to the economic dimension of CSR; still, they also value to the social and environmental CSR dimensions. Unexpectedly, emerging market MNEs (EMNEs) suffer more from the liability of emergingness in other emerging countries than in developed countries. Despite the persistence of certain cross-national differences, the overall influential structure on job choice remains largely similar across countries, opening up the possibility for a global employer branding strategy. Our results, moreover, suggest that symbolic attributes are as important as instrumental attributes to applicants. Most interestingly, the economic dimension of CSR and the country of origin are considered even more important than salary in Vietnam.",art

Integrating insights from conservation of resources theory related to both the positive effects of resources and the detrimental effects of resource loss, this paper examines the effect of job autonomy (an organizational-level resource) on subjective physical pain as mediated by mental health, with experienced workplace incivility (a social stressor) included as a boundary condition. Drawing from the results of a state-wide survey of local government professionals (N = 289), we test a moderated mediation model that estimates the relationships amongst job autonomy, mental health, and physical pain, at differing levels of experienced incivility. Mental health is found to fully mediate the negative relationship between job autonomy and physical pain. When the moderating effect of workplace incivility is incorporated into the model, higher levels of uncivil behavior weaken the otherwise positive and significant effect of job autonomy on mental health. However, the relationship between mental health and physical pain does not depend on levels of workplace incivility. This research has important implications for the management of physical and mental health at work. In particular, the results point to a need to develop human resource policies and practices that both promote job autonomy and tackle experiences of workplace incivility, particularly in local governments.",art

This inductive research reveals an invisible form of mundane extremity caused by the organisational system and inefficient HRM practices. Based on 30 interviews with social workers across Australia, we employed an interpretivist approach to coding and analysing the data thematically. We identified four paradoxical tensions existing in the domains of occupation, organisation, interpersonal, and work roles that hinder social workers' capabilities to help clients. These tensions generate perceptions of a lack of support, a lack of resources, and role expectation violation, as well as negative feelings of supportlessness, helplessness, powerlessness, and hopelessness, subsequently resulting in physical, psychological, and emotional exhaustion for social workers. Since the inefficiency-driven demands occur in the work processes and not the work itself, they are often not accounted for in the official workload and contribute to mundane work extremity in an invisible manner. Our research enriches the understanding of work extremity, introduces a work extremity lens to understand social work, and connects work extremity research to HRM practices.",art

However, studies of the role human resources (HR) in innovation have tended to focus on the individual level. Yet, broader strategic choices about HR can also impact innovation, and specifically the patent productivity of the firm. Here we draw on the attention-based view to guide the examination of three key concerns for strategic HR management by the top management team (TMT), and the relationship of these variables with patent productivity. We specifically examine TMT rhetoric, presence of an HR executive on the TMT, and HR slack. Our examination shows that the innovation rhetoric of the TMT can be beneficial to patent productivity, while HR slack detracts from patent productivity. Looking deeper we find limited support for the notion that time lags positively moderate the influence of innovation rhetoric and the HR executive effect on patent productivity.",art

This paper, alongside five special issue contributions, explores the enactment of technologically mediated HRM in the gig economy. We make the case for enhanced research efforts on HRM without employment contexts. More specifically, there is a need for greater appreciation of the diversity within the digital platform classification, and what this may mean for the role and value of HRM. While gig workers tend to fall outside the HRM field's remit, we expose how this is problematic given the presence of several activities and practices that one traditionally associates with the HR function.",art

Scholars investigating how organizations best can facilitate such an employee brand support have largely ignored the role of HRM and leader-member exchange (LMX). To test for this data from a survey among Norwegian hospital employees were analyzed. As hypothesized, we found positive relationships between high-commitment HRM and LMX and three manifestations of employee brand support, namely reputation strategy embeddedness, brand-congruent behaviour, and brand development participation. Organizational commitment mediated all the relationships. Examining HRM and LMX simultaneously, we found that LMX moderated the relationship between high-commitment HRM and reputation strategy embeddedness.

Moreover, Study 2 (n = 196), based on a field study using two-wave surveys, shows that APC fulfillment mediates the relationship between diversity-related organizational obligations and intention to pursue fulltime employment with the organization. These results suggest that when recruiting interns, employers should be intentional regarding promises made during recruitment to promote accurate APC formation. This is particularly important regarding diversity messaging, because interns hold promises made about diversity more strictly than promises of exclusivity and competitiveness.",art

Although academic production in intelligent automation (e.g. artificial intelligence, robotics) has grown rapidly, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of the utilization of these technologies in human resource management (HRM) at an organizational (firms) and individual (employees) level. This study therefore aims to systematize the academic inputs on intelligent automation so far and to clarify what are its main contributions to and challenges for HRM. In a systematic search of 13,136 potentially relevant studies published in the top HRM, international business (IB), general management (GM) and information management (IM) journals, we found 45 articles studying artificial intelligence, robotics and other advanced technologies within HRM settings. Results show that intelligent automation technologies constitute a new approach to managing employees and enhancing firm performance, thus offering several opportunities for HRM but also considerable challenges at a technological and ethical level. The impact of these technologies has been identified to concentrate on HRM strategies, namely, job replacement, human-robot/AI collaboration, decision-making and learning opportunities, and HRM activities, namely, recruiting, training and job performance. This study discusses these shifts in detail, along with the main contributions to theory and practice and directions for future research.",art

Organizational gender diversity may not be as well received among male employees as among female employees, particularly in countries characterized by gender inequality. Through the lens of intergroup threat theory (intergroup threat is experienced when members of one group perceive that another group is in a position to cause them actual or symbolic harm), we conceptualize organizational gender diversity as a threat to male employees, which evokes male employees' voluntary turnover, but as a support (threat mitigation) to female employees, which reduces female employees' voluntary turnover. We also investigate whether certain types of human resource (HR) practices can moderate the gendered implication of organizational gender diversity for voluntary turnover. By analyzing data from South Korea, we found that while collective incentives negatively moderated the positive relationship between organizational gender diversity and male employees' voluntary turnover, childcare benefits strengthened the negative relationship between organizational gender diversity and female employees' voluntary turnover.",art

This research focuses on the HR strategy implementation process, and in particular on the concept of HR system strength. In this paper we analyze the impact of HR system strength on collective affective commitment and examine this relationship from a contingent perspective, taking into account the moderating effect of leader-member exchange (LMX) and organizational size. The statistical analysis of data obtained from a sample of 142 Spanish companies and 504 key employees indicates that, when the effect of HR practices on collective affective commitment is controlled for, the strength of the HR system also has a positive and significant effect on this affective commitment. Moreover, we conclude that this relationship is not the same for all companies, but depends on the level of LMX in the organization. That is, depending on the overall relationship between leaders and subordinates in the organization, the effect of HR system strength on workforce affective commitment will vary. In particular, when the relationships between leaders and followers are good, the effect of HR system strength on affective commitment is lower.",art

Externalized employment, aimed at reducing labor costs, is becoming increasingly prevalent. However, the effective implementation of management practices to improve the career mobility of outsourced employees remains unknown. Drawing from social cognitive theory, this study constructs a self-driven career mobility model for outsourced employees. What's more, this study proposes the concept of differentiation in perceived organizational supports (DPOS), that is 'the relative degree of outsourced employee's perception of support from client organizational exceeds that from supplier organization in triangular employment relationships', and regards it as a key boundary condition for outsourced employees to interpret the cognition of employment opportunities. Data were collected from a three-wave survey of 271 outsourced employees from 52 interorganizational teams. Results showed that the perceived likelihood of standard employment (PLSE) by client organizations positively predicts outsourced employees' turnover intention from supplier organization. Job-related human capital development (JRHCD) and occupational self-efficacy play a chain mediating role between PLSE and turnover intention. DPOS moderates the relationship between PLSE and JRHCD, and also moderates the mediating and chain mediating effect of JRHCD and occupational self-efficacy. We discuss the implications of findings for outsourcing management research and practice.",art

Previous reviews of Black et al's expatriation and repatriation adjustment models have evaluated the influence and reliability of the models. In this paper, we examine the changing and varied nature of engagement with the models in journal articles on international adjustment to investigate the implications of contemporary changes among expatriates and their behaviours and experiences. 699 peer-reviewed academic articles published between 1991 and 2021 were systematically reviewed. Our analysis reveals that while more than 80% of the articles referenced their model(s), only a third explicitly applied the model(s). Drawing on our findings, we advance a revised version of Black et al's conceptual framework, which integrates their models into a combined stage-adjustment model applicable to both assigned expatriates (AEs) and non-assigned expatriates (NAEs).",art

Research on body art as a component of aesthetic labour has predominantly focused on individuals with tattoos in the global north, but little is known about tribal marks as a key element of aesthetic labour that leads to discriminatory or prejudicial attitudes in the workplace. Tribal marks are facial inscriptions that symbolize clan, family, and ethnic affiliation, and serve to distinguish one sociocultural group from another. In this article, we examine the lived experiences of people with tribal marks in Nigeria by developing a theoretical framework based on literatures on aesthetic labour, social stigmatisation, and discrimination. Drawing on the accounts of 42 individuals with tribal marks, we demonstrate how aestheticized work environments, biased assumptions, and negative perceptions about individuals with tribal marks can lead to discriminatory or prejudicial behaviours at work. We further discuss the psychosocial consequences and explain why tribal marks are now perceived to be outdated and damaging to those individuals who have them. We offer a novel perspective on the existing knowledge about aesthetic labour and broaden our understanding of another form of 'lookism' in a non-Western context.",art

While extensive research has explored the relationship between HRM and various organizational and employee outcomes, there remains a significant gap in the literature regarding the role of HRM in discouraging extreme work. To address this gap, building mainly on stakeholder theory, we specifically propose that HR managers' ethical leadership negatively influences precarious work, which serves as a catalyst for extreme work cultures by exacerbating workloads, prolonging working hours, and intensifying physical and mental stress. Importantly, we propose that sustainable HRM mediates the association between HR managers' ethical leadership and precarious work. Finally, the present study hypothesizes that HR managers' political skill acts as a boundary condition for the effects of HR managers' ethical leadership on sustainable HRM and precarious work. Data collected from two sources (260 employees and the same number of HR managers) employing a time-lagged design supported our hypotheses. Other than theoretical contributions to different important knowledge areas, such as ethical leadership, HRM, and precarious work, we offer a number of practical implications that could help organizations counter extreme work and its negative repercussions mainly for employees.",art

Drawing on person-job fit theory, we theorize and empirically analyze the effects of host country language skills on two work-related outcomes: workplace social support and perceived overqualification. We further examine how these outcomes are related with job satisfaction. Empirically, we analyze these relationships using data from three sub-studies of foreign academics in the Nordic region. The first is a survey filled in by 496 foreign academics working at 18 universities in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. The second is an interview study of 41 foreign academics employed by a large international university in Finland. The third consists of nine interviews across Finland, Sweden, and Norway where we followed up on the analysis of the data from the first two sub-studies. Whilst we use the quantitative dataset to test our hypotheses, our qualitative data allows us to dig deeper into how making investments in local language skills does not necessary lead to positive work-related outcomes as perceived by foreign academics, and what HR implications these perceptions have for international organizations, such as universities. Overall, our findings provide important insights into the complex and contextual nature of host country language skills' role and effects in international organizations.",art

Based on emotional labor theory, we aim to study the relationships between the dimensions of emotional labor (requirements and strategies), work engagement, and occupational identity in Portuguese police officers. Therefore, we intend to explore the possible effects of emotional labor both on work engagement and occupational identity, as well as ways of preventing and/or mitigating the impact of these relationships. We identified a gap in the studies on this subject in Portugal, particularly in the context of police professionals. Thus, a sample of 924 Portuguese police officers of the Public Security Police (PSP) was asked to answer a set of questionnaires: the Emotional Labour Scale, the Emotion Work Requirements Scale, the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, and the Social Identity Scale. The data obtained was analyzed using correlation and multiple linear regression. Overall, the results revealed relationships between the emotional demands (i.e., suppression of negative emotions and expression of positive emotions) and strategies (i.e., deep and surface acting) of emotional labor and work engagement as well as occupational identity.

The purpose of this study is to examine the dynamic relationship between daily job characteristics proposed by job characteristics theory (job autonomy, task variety, significance, identity, and feedback) and change oriented organizational citizenship behavior (OCB-CH). A daily diary survey study design was used, in which 61 employees working in different organizations in Greece, completed a structured questionnaire for five consecutive working days (N=305 occasions). Results from multilevel regression analysis supported the role of daily job autonomy, daily task significance and daily job feedback as within-person positive correlates of OCB-CH. Our model explained 17.72% of the variance in OCB-CH ratings. The study highlights the importance of core job characteristics, for the execution of daily OCB-CH in organizations. However not all job characteristics are suitable for promoting the execution of daily OCB-CH. Managers can enhance their employees' daily OCB-CH by interventions aiming at increasing daily task variety, and task significance along with the degree of daily job autonomy granted to employees.",art

Global professionals need to understand the demands of the cultural context in which they are working and respond effectively within it. Building on existing literature highlighting the importance of cross-cultural competencies and international experience for global work, this study expands knowledge by examining whether employees with cross-cultural competencies and international experience are better able to vary their cross-cultural responses to effectively match the cultural demands of the work environment. Tested with nearly 500 professionals globally, this study found that cultural humility, tolerance of ambiguity, and international experience predict professionals' abilities to accurately judge the best cultural response for a given work-related situation. The findings have implications for international human resource management in two ways. First, organizations should assess for cross-cultural competencies to select for roles requiring an understanding of the cultural context. Second, organizations should provide international experiences as part of a global leadership or global talent development program.",art

During the COVID-19 crisis, telecommuting has gradually attracted the public's attention. Past studies on the subject have produced inconsistent findings, suggesting that telecommuting can lead to simultaneous benefits and drawbacks. To discuss the deeper reasons for this finding, we divided telecommuting into two types-voluntary and involuntary telecommuting. Based on the job demands-resources model, we explored the impact of voluntary-involuntary telecommuting on employee innovative behaviour through co-worker emotional support, and we examined the cross-level moderating effect of organisational identification. Using the daily diary method, we collected 455 valid observations from 65 employees for eight consecutive days. The results show that compared with involuntary telecommuting, voluntary telecommuting leads to more co-worker emotional support, in a mediating role, and employee innovative behaviour. Furthermore, a high level of organisational identification enlarges the difference in co-worker emotional support for employees voluntarily or involuntarily telecommuting. Our results uncover those differences and fill the research gap on telecommuter motivation.",art

Artificial intelligence (AI) and other AI-based applications are being integrated into firms' human resource management (HRM) approaches for managing people in domestic and international organisations. The last decade has seen a growth in AI-based applications proliferating the HRM function, triggering an exciting new stream of research on topics such as the social presence of AI and robotics, effects of AI adoption on individual and business level outcomes, and evaluating AI-enabled HRM practices. Adopting these technologies has resulted in how work is organised in local and international firms, noting opportunities for employees and firms' resource utilisation, decision-making, and problem-solving. However, despite a growing interest in scholarship, research on AI-based technologies for HRM is limited and fragmented. Further research is needed that analyses the role of AI-assisted applications in HRM functions and human-AI interactions in large multinational enterprises diffusing such innovations. In response to these combined issues-the fragmented nature of research and limited extant literature, we present a systematic review on the theme of this special issue and offer a nuanced understating of what is known, yet to be known, and future research directions to frame a future research agenda for international HRM. We develop a conceptual framework that integrates research on AI applications in HRM and offers a cohesive base for future research endeavours.

Strong HRM systems, characterized by HRM processes that send clear and consistent messages to employees about what their employer values, expects and rewards, should be associated with a range of valued individual and organizational outcomes. Nonetheless, there are few empirical studies of the anticipated ties, especially at a unit-level of analysis. This study uses situational strength theory to test Bowen and Ostroff ' s proposition that HRM systems contribute to firm performance when they communicate messages around strategic objectives in a manner that ensures a shared interpretation among employees. As one of the few studies to examine the extent to which shared interpretations of the messages communicated by HR practices associate with strategic organization climate and performance, we assess the effects of the HRM system strength construct at both the individual and group levels. As hypothesized, employee perceptions of HRM system strength associated positively with work-related attitudes and behavior. At the unit level, HRM system strength was positively linked to a strategic climate and to business performance (e.g. net income against target). This study draws attention to the importance of capturing the group level attributes of the HRM system strength construct.",art

Although a large body of research has explored how organizational social capital (OSC) benefits organizational performance, results are not conclusive. Consequently, scholars have called for more research on the factors that may moderate the effects of OSC on organizational performance. We address this research gap and examine the role of nepotism, which is the preferential treatment of family members in human resource management (HRM)-related decisions, such as development or rewards, in the relationship between OSC and organizational performance. Using a sample of 77 family firms in Switzerland, we found that the relationship between OSC and organizational performance is stronger in firms with higher nepotism. This research contributes to the HRM literature by exploring how the preferential treatment of family members in HRM-related decisions (i.e. greater nepotism) can provide benefits to family firms in terms of the impact of OSC on organizational performance.",art

The nature of work and employment relations of small Chinese migrant businesses in South Africa remains largely under-researched, despite the significant growth of these businesses since the 2000s. Based on 90 interviews with Chinese business owners and their African workers, we found that, although employment relations were largely transactional and adversarial, they sometimes also incorporated symbiotic accommodations with third-country undocumented immigrant workers and pockets of de facto responsible autonomy. Material imbalances of power were notably alleviated through workers' superior local language skills and cultural familiarity, enabling them to carve out space as intermediaries with customers and other local stakeholders to counter the power of employers. However, this autonomy is relatively small in scope, in large part due to the precarious nature of the employment and the workers' immigration status.",art

This study examines the association between two aspects of HRM, the use of controls (beliefs, interactive, boundary, diagnostic) and the effectiveness of performance management systems (PMSs), which are assessed in respect to the achievement of process outcomes and hospital performance. The findings indicate that the achievement of process outcomes (both performance-related and staff-related outcomes) mediates the relationship between controls and hospital performance. Specifically, the achievement of performance-related outcomes mediates the associations between belief systems and the use of diagnostic controls with hospital performance (medical facilities), and the achievement of staff-related outcomes mediates the association between the use of diagnostic controls with the support facilities and effectiveness dimensions of hospital performance. In addition, the use of specific controls exhibits a direct impact on hospital performance with beliefs systems directly positively associated with all five hospital performance dimensions, the use of interactive controls positively associated with three dimensions (medical facilities, patient care, and staff resources), the diagnostic use of controls associated with the patient care dimension, and boundary controls positively associated with all dimensions of hospital performance except staff resources.

HR Analytics (HRA) are said to create value when providing analytical outputs that are relevant to decision-makers' immediate business issues. While extant research on HRA attributes success (or lack thereof) in providing business relevant outputs to the presence or absence of particular skills and resources, we know little about how practitioners actually mobilize these skills and resources in daily practice. Drawing on observational and interview data from a case study of an HRA team, we identify boundary spanning, customizing dashboards, and speaking a language of numbers as three epistemic practices in which team members combine and mobilize a particular set of skills and resources that allows them to accomplish epistemic alignment, i.e. aligning to decision-makers' perception of business reality when creating analytical outputs. Epistemic alignment enables the team members to produce complex analytical outputs while at the same time staying close to the decision-makers' immediate business problems. At the same time, team members are capable of accounting for conditions in the broader organizational context, such as compliance issues, dependencies, political tensions, and a prevailing data-driven decision culture. Our findings contribute to knowledge on how organizations can build effective HRA and how advanced forms of digitalization transform the work of HRM in contemporary organizations.",art

This study explores the influence of legal uncertainties on the process of innovating human resources (HR) practices in developing countries. Through a case study focused on introducing remote work within Kazakhstan's Technical Gas Industry during a healthcare crisis, we examine the multifaceted challenges and opportunities that emerge when navigating a complex legal landscape. Our findings reveal that legal uncertainties, stemming from inadequacies in legislation and the tightness of norms, significantly impede the ability to adapt and modernize HR practices during crises. Furthermore, the criticality of the company's position within the industry, combined with a low degree of legal enforcement, underscores the concept of 'responsibilization' among HR professionals. This phenomenon compels HR practitioners to assume greater responsibility and make strategic decisions that occasionally push the boundaries of existing laws and regulations. In this context, we propose a novel conceptualization of responsibilization, distinct from empowerment, as it involves embracing negative legal consequences associated with proactive decision-making during crises. This study contributes significantly to our understanding of how legal uncertainties influence the process of HR innovation in developing countries, highlighting the intricate interplay between regulatory frameworks, crisis management, and organizational transformation.",art

As knowledge hiding has become an increasingly widespread phenomenon within organizations, there has been a dramatic increase in research on this topic over the past two decades. However, previous studies have provided inconsistent conclusions on why knowledge hiding occurs and how it affects the perpetrator's subsequent work and well-being outcomes. As no reviews to date have focused on the knowledge hiding from the perpetrator's perspective, this meta-analysis systematically synthesizes frequently studied antecedents and consequences of perpetrator-centric knowledge hiding. It also examines the moderating effects of cultural dimensions and causal directions on the consequences. Based on evidence from N = 193 sources with a total sample size of N = 68,113, this meta-analysis found significantly strong relationships between neuroticism, moral disengagement (hider's factors), psychological contract breach, toxic leadership, leader-signaled knowledge hiding, perceived organizational politics (contextual factors) and knowledge hiding. The findings revealed that knowledge hiding had a medium-sized positive relationship with perpetrator psychological strain. It also uncovered the cross-cultural differences among the perpetrator-centric consequences. These findings helped answer the question of whether some common predictors or outcomes of knowledge hiding should be identified as outcomes or indicators.

We examine to what extent the gender pay gap at top executive level is linked to gender stereotypes, i.e. to societal beliefs about the attributes women and men possess and the roles they ought to perform. We theorize that, even at the highest hierarchical level of an organization, executive functions are gender stereotyped: some (such as IT) are considered typically 'masculine', while others (such as human resources) are considered typically 'feminine'. We argue gender stereotyping at the executive level to be related to pay such that masculine functions are paid more than feminine ones. Referring to role congruity theory, we further argue that women are paid better when they hold less masculine and therefore more role congruous functions. We find supportive evidence for both predictions when studying large European companies across the years 2014 to 2018. Pay data for 353 executives were linked to results of a survey in which participants were asked to rate the masculinity of the areas of responsibility of different executive functions. We find an empirical pattern that reflects a Catch 22 situation in which women executives appear unable to increase their pay by switching to more masculine functions that are, on average, better paid.",art

Human resource outsourcing (HRO) has been an important development in the HRM function since the 1990s as organizations seek cost reduction and competitive advantages. Does HRO enhance organizational competitiveness and strategic capability? Based on a systematic review of 97 journal articles published between 1999 and 2022, we identify several key patterns of existing research on HRO, such as a heavy reliance on quantitative methods, the dominance of traditional economic theories, and a focus mainly on the perspective of client organizations. However, whether HRO services can accomplish organizational strategic capability remains equivocal. To unpack the relationship between HRO and organizational performance, we establish an HRO process model which includes several blocks: HRO decision, HRO implementation, HRO perception, HRO evaluation, and HRO maintenance. Among these blocks, there is a dynamic interplay between multiple stakeholders across fields. We call for future HRO research and practice to pay attention to employee perception to enhance HRO's effect and value as part of strategic human resource management, thus extending HR system strength theory. We also call for future research to clarify the contextual role of emerging technology in promoting HRO, given the increasing use of digital technology and HR data analytics.",art

In the face of an increasingly pressing refugee crisis, understanding how organizations' human resource management (HRM) support practices are perceived by refugee workers is critical not only for refugee well-being but also organizational effectiveness. Grounded on self-determination theory (SDT), the current study contributes to this understanding by 1) testing refugee workers' perceptions of HRM support practices as helpful or needs-satisfying-in terms of fulfilling autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs, and 2) exploring the mechanisms-why refugees find the practices needs satisfying. We surveyed both refugee (n = 99) and non-refugee workers (n = 345) in the U.S. The findings highlighted that, compared to non-refugees, refugee workers tend to view autonomy practices as especially helpful. Moreover, some of the need differences were mediated by refugees' higher work centrality.

The nature of gig work - temporary, task-based work that is facilitated by applications and platforms - lacks the structural, interpersonal, and organizational dynamics of leadership. Instead, algorithms and software are the primary source of organizational and informational resources for a gig worker in a process known as 'algorithmic management'. Job performance and career success depends primarily on the individual gig worker's ability to establish objectives, identify strategies, and develop skills for job performance on their own. As such, success in gig work is likely to be connected to self-leadership ability. Drawing on the psychological perspectives of control theory and conservation of resources theory, we find that the agency provided by self-leadership is generally beneficial to rideshare drivers (N = 924) in that it increases both well-being and the intention to seek non-gig work. However, enacting this agency as a leaderless worker is an intensive process, and can either be a resource gain or drain. We find that workers experience better or worse outcomes, respectively, under circumstances of high job satisfaction or high financial stress. Implications and directions for future HRM research and practice among other gig and traditional worker populations are discussed.",art

We primarily examine how two types of organizational commitment (i.e. affective commitment and continuance commitment) mediate the effect of the supervisors' ethical leadership on their followers' UPB. Collecting data from 291 employees in South Korea, at two points in time, we found that ethical leadership has a negative relationship with follower UPB through affective commitment and has a positive relationship with follower UPB through continuance commitment. Furthermore, follower organizational identification moderates the mediation processes, which makes the affective commitment-UPB relationship more negative but the continuance commitment-UPB relationship more positive when the followers more closely identify with their organization.

We consider HRM psychologization as indicated by a disciplinary (i.e., the relative contribution of psychology and other fields to HRM research) and an inter-disciplinary component (i.e., knowledge integration of psychology and other fields in HRM research). Accordingly, we apply two bibliometric methods (i.e., citation and co-citation analysis) to a sample of 6,709 articles published in six HRM journals from 2000 to 2021. Overall, psychology became more influential as a citation source in HRM research but integrated more closely with other intellectual sources in the period examined. In addition, HRM psychologization was contingent on HRM journals, the first authors' countries, and HRM subdomains. This study presents an enriched pattern of psychologization as well as substantial quantitative evidence that confirms, counters, or extends prior findings.",art

Research on diversity programs provides inconclusive knowledge regarding their effect on firm performance. In this study, we build on the Ability-Motivation-Opportunity framework to examine the relationship between firm diversity-enhancement program bundle and firm performance. Based on a dataset covering 2,794 U.S. publicly listed firms over 15 years, we find support for our hypothesis that firm diversity-enhancement program bundle results in a greater pay-off when it is coupled with a stronger employee ownership program at the firm level or a greater technological opportunity at the industry level. Furthermore, the pay-off is greatest when a firm's diversity-enhancement program bundle, its employee ownership program, and its environmental technological opportunity are all high. Overall, our study provides nuanced theoretical and empirical accounts regarding a firm's integrated diversity-enhancement efforts. It also provides novel managerial implications regarding when firms can reap the most benefit from their integrated diversity-enhancement efforts.",art

The extent to which individuals feel that they are known and understood by others (i.e., self-verification perceptions) is related to a number of important employee outcomes. However, we know little about what contextual and personal factors are associated with self-verification perceptions, and if such perceptions are related to employees' discrete emotions. Time-lagged data collected from 163 employees revealed that perceived organizational and supervisor support were positively associated with self-verification perceptions, which were in turn related to more positive and less negative emotions. We also found that having high proactive personality significantly enhanced the relationship between perceived organizational support and self-verification perceptions but reduced the relationship between perceived supervisor support and self-verification perceptions. The results provide evidence of the importance of supportive work environments and proactive individual traits to help employees feel known and understood.",art

Talent Management (TM) has emerged as a key strategic issue for global organizations. Despite the growth of global sports entities, research on TM in this context is scarce. This paper addresses this research gap and investigates major challenges in TM faced by organizations in professional sports business and makes an increasingly significant contribution towards the global economy. The question of what constitutes 'talent' in sports and how it can be strategically managed is a matter of concern which expands the knowledge and understanding of Talent Management practices in a unique and rapidly developing sector. The current study explores the scope and boundaries of TM practices for professional sports entities in the context of emerging economies. The study uses case study approach to examine TM for the Nepal based Everest Premier League (EPL) The study draws on the Social Exchange Theory (SET) and Human Capital Theory (HCT) to understand talent management practices and demonstrates how differing natures of socio-economic exchange can be observed across actors and stages of TM in the business of sports.",art

Employees contribute to organizational effectiveness in a variety of ways that go beyond job specific task performance. Organizational citizenship behavior and contextual performance describe behaviors that are discretionary, but still important. Contextual performance supports the organization's social and interpersonal infrastructure. Research suggests employees' overall effectiveness ratings are influenced by both task performance and contextual performance. If it is truly discretionary, contextual performance should contribute more to overall effectiveness when workers have more autonomy. This study explores the relationship between autonomy, task performance and interpersonal facilitation, a dimension of contextual performance. Results for N = 135 air force technicians suggest perceived autonomy moderates the relationship between interpersonal facilitation and overall effectiveness. Autonomy did not moderate the relationship between task performance and overall effectiveness.",art

Conflict is inevitable and an essential part of organizational life, as the goals of employers and employees are often incompatible. In this study, by employing both qualitative and quantitative methods, we inductively identified the categories of labor relations conflicts (interest-based, rights-based, and affect-based conflicts) and developed a three-dimensional scale that reflects employees' perceptions of labor relations conflicts in the Chinese context. By using matched data from 1223 employees and 136 human resource (HR) managers and employing hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analysis, we tested the hypotheses and examined the effectiveness of partnership practices on reducing labor relations conflicts, the negative effects of labor relations conflicts on employees' attitudes and behaviors, and the mediating role of labor relations conflicts on the relationship between partnership practices and employees' attitudes and behaviors. The theoretical contributions and practical implications of the findings are discussed.",art

Integrating perspectives of absorptive capacity and strategic human resource management, we examine how high commitment work systems (HCWS) affect a firm's absorptive capacity and subsequent new product and service performance. We posit that HCWS act as an antecedent of a firm's absorptive capacity-the organizational ability to acquire, assimilate, transform and exploit knowledge. We also posit that HCWS strengthen the positive relationship between absorptive capacity and new product and service performance. Results from a sample of 198 firms support the major contention. This study shows that a firm's realized absorptive capacity partially mediates the relationship between potential absorptive capacity and new product and service performance. In the process of a firm's deploying absorptive capacity to enhancing new product and service performance, HCWS exhibit distinctive strategic value. They not only play an organizational capability-building role that fosters a firm's absorptive capacity, but may also play an efficiency-enhancing role that facilitates the process of transforming absorptive capacity into superior new product and service performance. This study sheds light on how human resource practices affect the development and effectiveness of organizational capabilities.",art

This study investigates the critical role of employees in shaping frontline managers' (FLMs) HR implementation. It goes beyond previous research, which recurrently attributes FLMs' implementation behavior to the facilitating conditions and FLMs' personal capabilities, overlooking or downplaying the potential impact of employees during the implementation process. In doing so, we characterize the construct of intra-team acceptance of espoused HR practices as a key force influencing FLMs' HR enactment. Hence, we hypothesize how intra-team acceptance of espoused HR practices is linked to FLMs' implementation behavior through FLMs' performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence. In this narrative, we position team-level HPWS as a direct outcome of FLMs' implementation behavior. Therefore, we establish that team-level HPWS mediates the relationship between FLMs' implementation behavior and team performance, underscoring the importance of employees in the HRM variability debate. Conducting a time-lagged study and analyzing data collected from 23 South Korean firms, we found support for our theoretical claims. Our findings recognize employees as significant contributors to the implementation process and challenge the conventional wisdom in which employees are viewed as passive recipients of HR practices. We discuss theoretical and managerial implications and offer directions for future endeavors.",art

Machine Learning (ML) algorithms offer a powerful tool for capturing multifaceted relationships through inductive research to gain insights and support decision-making in practice. This study contributes to understanding the dilemma whereby the more complex ML becomes, the more its value proposition can be compromised by its opacity. Using a longitudinal dataset on voluntary employee turnover from a German federal agency, we provide evidence for the underlying trade-off between predictive performance and transparency for ML, which has not been found in similar Human Resource Management (HRM) studies using artificially simulated datasets. We then propose measures to mitigate this trade-off by demonstrating the use of post-hoc explanatory methods to extract local (employee-specific) and global (organisation-wide) predictor effects. After that, we discuss their limitations, providing a nuanced perspective on the circumstances under which the use of post-hoc explanatory methods is justified. Namely, when a 'transparency-by-design' approach with traditional linear regression is not sufficient to solve HRM prediction tasks, the translation of complex ML models into human-understandable visualisations is required. As theoretical implications, this paper suggests that we can only fully understand the multi-layered HR phenomena explained to us by real-world data if we incorporate ML-based inductive methods together with traditional deductive methods.",art

This paper examines the cross-national transfer of HRM practices at Up Group, an emblematic French multinational worker co-op. Our findings reveal that stakeholder pressure to disseminate the co-op's core HRM practices to its foreign subsidiaries triggered two key strategic responses from the HQ member-owners: transfer circumvention and ceremonial transfer. Therefore, our study provides new insights into the political and contested nature of practice transfer by elucidating how MNCs actively engage in the selective and differential transfer of some of their core HRM practices to protect the HQ actors' interests and preserve their position of power vis-a-vis the subsidiaries. In addition, our fine-grained analysis of the ceremonially transferred practices contributes to the literature on practice variation during diffusion processes in MNCs. Finally, by examining the challenges of the cross-national management of people in multinational worker co-ops, an increasingly important global player, this study addresses critical management scholars' calls to broaden the horizons of IHRM research beyond the hegemonic analysis of for-profit shareholder-owned MNCs.",art

The COVID-19 pandemic has placed significant and extreme pressure on frontline healthcare workers, including paramedics. Yet, within the human resource management (HRM) literature, little is known about how working in extreme conditions affects individual behaviours and wellbeing, or how HRM may provide coping strategies. Drawing on conservation of resources theory (COR), our study provides insights into how COVID-stress influences paramedic burnout by considering the mediating role of resilience and the moderating role of perceived organisational support (POS). Findings from a survey of 648 paramedic workers employed in Victoria, Australia, during the height of the 2020 pandemic lockdowns confirm our hypotheses. COVID-stress was negatively related to resilience. We find that resilience mediated the positive relationship between COVID-stress and burnout. Moreover, POS acted as a protective buffer, thus reducing the negative effects of COVID-stress. We make an important contribution to the literature on extreme work, as represented by COVID-stress, by demonstrating that perceived organisational support is a key resource that supports and ensures the sustainability of paramedics engaging in extreme work.",art

Companies that nurture a shared corporate culture based on specific corporate values can improve their performance. However, when companies expand globally, communicating and transferring these values can be challenging, particularly when there are significant linguistic and cultural differences. This qualitative study examined the case of a small Norwegian IT company that has put its two corporate values at the core of its activity, and how these values were transferred to a subsidiary in India. Drawing on the concept of recontextualization and socialization theory, the study investigates the following: (1) how the corporate values were transferred, recontextualized and renegotiated in the Indian subsidiary; (2) how those values were implemented through a set of socialization mechanisms. Our main findings reveal how the Indian leaders actively recontextualized the values into prevailing cultural practices in India, and how senior employees were engaged in the value transfer process. Moreover, this article outlines how a small company without a formal HR department and with no expatriates to guide the process can use soft control mechanisms related to more formalized and structured HR practices to implement the headquarters' values. Additionally, the article discusses the theoretical and practical implications of the findings.",art

There remains a significant knowledge gap in HRM regarding the inclusion of transgender (henceforth 'trans') workers. We examine and apply the emerging concept of allyship (a specific form of active support and advocacy for minority groups) to trans workers, and in doing so we advance a new model of allyship intentions and perceptions. We test our model across two studies. The first extends theorising on perceived diversity and inclusion climate (PDIC) and social dominance orientation (SDO) to explain how non-trans workers can exhibit trans allyship intentions. When non-trans workers were presented with a scenario of a co-worker disclosing their trans identity, we find that SDO is negatively related with allyship intentions, yet PDIC moderates this relationship, such that the negative impact of SDO is buffered by the positive influence of PDIC. The second study builds upon theorising on psychological safety and authenticity to explain how perceived allyship facilitates the wellbeing of trans workers. We find, in a survey of trans workers, that perceived allyship is positively associated with psychological safety and authenticity at work; and is indirectly related to work engagement via the former and to life satisfaction via the latter. We provide critical insights into how allyship can be advanced to understand and support trans inclusion.",art

Despite the growing interest in work engagement crossover among employees, we still need more research about the role of the supervisors' work engagement on employees' states and behaviors. This study examines the relationship between the supervisors' work engagement and the employees' work engagement. We also investigate how supervisors' and employees' work engagement relate to employees' in-role and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Finally, we explore the mediating role of employees' affective commitment linking employees' and supervisors' work engagement to employees' performance. To test the proposed model, we performed multilevel models with a sample of 570 employees nested around 88 supervisors from 7 organizations in Ecuador. Results show that supervisors' work engagement is not related to employees' work engagement. Employees' affective commitment partially mediates the relationship between employees' work engagement and performance, whereas employees' affective commitment fully mediates the relationship between supervisors' work engagement and employee performance. Thus, employees' emotional attachment significantly impacts employee performance (in-role and organizational citizenship behavior) among engaged employees.",art

Employees' job crafting is important because it can result in better person-job fit and motivate better performance, producing favorable outcomes for both employees and organizations. Based on conservation of resources and job crafting theories, we examined effects of environmental resources (job security, autonomy, and feedback) on employees' crafting behaviors through organization-based self-esteem. Data were collected at two time points with a four-week interval. With 425 full-time U.S. employees, path analysis demonstrated that organization-based self-esteem (a personal resource) explained indirect relationships of environmental resources with job crafting behaviors. Furthermore, role ambiguity had a negative influence on the use of resources. It moderated the positive links between environmental resources and organization-based self-esteem, making them weaker, thereby limiting the indirect theoretical effect that resources could have on job crafting. Overall, findings suggest that environmental and personal resources are important antecedents of employees' proactive job crafting at work.",art

While flexible working-time arrangements are highly sought-after entitlements for the reconciliation of work and family responsibilities, they also risk workplace stigma and deterioration in users' (typically mothers') employment status and career prospects. Among potential influences on these outcomes is the formality of provisions. In this analysis we examine job satisfaction, work/family benefits and employment penalties among Australian mothers using flexible working arrangements, comparing the outcomes of those who accessed flexible working-time arrangements formally (through policy provisions available at their workplace) with the outcomes of those who used informally negotiated arrangements. Using data from a nationally representative cohort of working mothers, we show that the use of flexible working-time arrangements was positively associated with specific indicators of job satisfaction, and that this association was stronger among mothers who accessed formal arrangements. However, formality was positively associated not only with perceived benefits (such as more time with family) but also with problems (such as intensified workloads and lost opportunities for training). Overall, our findings suggest that while formality is important, it may also amplify the tension between benefits and penalties associated with flexible working-time arrangements.",art

Social exchange theory suggests that team members are willing to share their knowledge with each other due to the reciprocity motive stimulated by high-quality exchange relationships with their leader (LMX). However, the relationship may not be this simple. Applying the social learning and self-efficacy elements of social cognitive theory, we propose that team members with higher general self-efficacy are more likely to share knowledge with their teammates when they also enjoy high-quality LMX with the leader. In addition, we hypothesize that this effect is stronger when team members learn how to effectively share knowledge by observing their leader share knowledge or when the variances in LMX qualities within a team (LMX differentiation) are smaller. We also propose that knowledge sharing has a meaningful impact on performance at the team level and hypothesize that team-level knowledge sharing is positively related to team-level performance. Using a field sample of 342 individuals in 56 teams, we find support for our model. These findings advance our understanding of when and why individuals are willing to reciprocate higher-quality LMX relationships by sharing their knowledge with other teammates, and the positive effect this has on team performance.",art

In their quest to attract talent and appear as an employer of choice, organizations must articulate the benefits of having a diverse and inclusive workforce. By communicating the attractiveness of the workplace, a company increases its exposure to the environment as an employer of choice. Within the context of employer branding, we highlight two emerging concepts that encompass corporate communication in the form of diversity and inclusion statements: diversity branding and inclusion branding. We examine the websites of 75 major companies in five different countries (France, Germany, Spain, the UK and the US). The article highlights that organizations use diversity and inclusion branding to attract talent, become employers of choice and dimensionalize diversity to signal that specific dimensions of diversity are relevant to the organization. We show that diversity and inclusion branding has become 'mainstream' and how a focus on diversity is particularly useful to attract talent while to appear as an employer of choice a focus on inclusion seems particularly beneficial.",art

The surge of remote and hybrid work in the post-pandemic era has reinforced the blurred boundaries between work and nonwork responsibilities. Thus, how people manage the boundaries between work and nonwork domains has become more complicated. This study advances the work of previous studies on constant connectivity by focusing on how employees' perception of constant connectivity might actualize their boundary management behaviors. By adopting affordances for practice perspective, our study focused on contextual factors, including IT/internet policies, informal social norms, and work flexibility, to investigate how these factors could influence employees' perception of constant connectivity. This paper reports a two-phase study. In the first phase, we used sentiment analysis to rank 38 internet use policies of Australian universities, grading their strictness toward ICT/internet use. Next, building on the first phase, we interviewed 28 academics. We identified three perceptions of constant connectivity related to participants' practices, including constant connectivity as a resource for practice, a challenge for practice, and duality for practice. We also found five distinct boundary management behaviors connected to three different perceptions.",art

The social construction of gender has led to differences in beliefs, knowledge, experiences, or networks between women and men. Some argue that mixed gender teams can show perform better. However, empirical research at the firm level has provided mixed evidence. Moreover, these studies mainly focus on the board of directors or top management teams. Few have examined how middle management and staff levels affect firm performance. These levels form the operational layers that execute the business strategy and run daily operations. Using a unique dataset of 159 large French firms, we find that gender diversity at the two organisational levels positively impacts a firm's economic performance and contributes to its competitiveness. Gender diversity at these levels is a strategic resource that provides a sustainable competitive advantage by creating value and cannot be easily imitated by competitors quickly. We also find a nonlinear relationship due to a threshold effect related to a critical mass condition, and a hat-shaped relationship (two flat borders around the top) between gender diversity and firm performance. Specifically, firms with balanced diversity (between 40 and 60% women as employees) at the middle management and staff levels tend to be more profitable. Finally, predominantly male firms have similar performance to predominantly female firms, and that balanced-gender diversity is the real contributing factor to firm performance.",art

The increasing prevalence of nontraditional work arrangements has led to new talent management challenges for organizations. Given independent contractors (ICs) have the potential to bring considerable value to an organization, it is in an organization's best interest to establish a pool of loyal talent that is willing to return when needed (i.e. as boomerang ICs). Through the lens of the psychological contract, we examine factors that can contribute to retaining independent contractors. Using an international sample of ICs and an experimental research design, we demonstrate that ICs are less likely to return to an organization after a perceived psychological contract breach during a previous project for the same organization. This is especially true if they voluntarily work on a contract basis. Importantly, our results suggest that expectations of both a transactional and relational nature influence independent contractor loyalty to organizations. Our findings extend the limited research on talent management in nontraditional work arrangements, producing important theoretical and practical implications for the management of independent contractors within organizations.",art

Although protean and boundaryless career orientation have been seen mainly as different yet related constructs, a recent meta-analysis suggests a reconsideration of this career concept structure into a distinction between two independent dimensions of 'proactive career orientation' (including sub-dimensions 'self-directed', 'values driven', and 'boundaryless mindset') and 'physical mobility preferences' (including sub-dimension 'organizational mobility preference'). To examine whether or not this new proposed structure is sustained we analyze the dynamics between the boundaryless career orientation (using with subdimensions 'boundaryless mindset' and 'organizational mobility preference') and attitudinal outcomes of organizational commitment, job satisfaction, turnover intention and pay satisfaction. The results provide empirical validation for the propositions in the meta-analysis, not only regarding career concept structure but also its dynamics. They confirm areas of similarity of 'boundaryless mindset' and protean dynamics but also important differences between these dynamics for employees with a mobility preference. Boundaryless mindset employees are more intrinsically motivated and proactive in developing their career. Those having high organizational mobility preference are more extrinsically motivated and reactive when facing organizational and environmental determinants. The results show that a 'traditional' boundaryless career orientation is a two-sided coin and organizations need to differentially manage the diverse profiles of a boundaryless careers.",art

This paper examines the talent definitions held by multiple organisational stakeholders and the criteria used in the practice of identification. Drawing from content analysis of over 200 interviews, our findings demonstrate substantial discrepancies between senior leaders' and talents' view on the meaning of talent within organisations. Moreover, there was little awareness of the identification criteria used by decision-makers that gives individuals the talent designation. Given the potential impact of this designation on employee attitudes, behaviours, and performance, the seemingly limited relationship between the meaning ascribed to talent and the identification criteria used in practice is likely to raise concerns about fairness and transparency. The findings indicate the absence of a shared and well-defined talent philosophy which we suggest is needed to guide talent management practices.",art

In this study, we examine why and how HR metrics can help increase the legitimacy of the HR function in organizations.

We apprehend HR legitimacy through two key concepts: the strength of the HRM system and the underlying philosophies, or raison d'& ecirc;tre, attributed to the HR function, namely maximizing business performance and promoting employee well-being. Testing our model among a sample of 218 HR professionals in Canadian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we find that the relationships between HR metrics and HR philosophies are partially mediated by HRM strength. These results suggest that HR professionals can tap into the signalling power of HR metrics to enhance the legitimacy of the HR function by fostering shared perceptions that HR goals, activities, and contributions are valuable and aligned with the interests of both management and employees. This suggests that the use of HR metrics and analytics can help HR functions pursue a pluralist philosophy that seeks to enhance mutuality in employment relationships.

Organizations can support employee well-being through a wide variety of HRM practices, which can be summarized as well-being-oriented HRM (WBHRM). It is unclear, however, whether these practices can also foster the well-being of teleworkers. Indeed, due to reduced visibility and salience, it is likely that WBHRM is less or even not effective in the telework context. To prove this assumption, we analyze how strong specific domains of WBHRM are related to different dimensions of employee well-being (including happiness, health, and relational well-being) in a non-telework and telework context. In the telework context, we also analyze the moderating role of telework intensity. Our analyses are based on data from 1,980 German employees at two consecutive points in time. Our findings reveal that the overall relationship between WBHRM and employee well-being in terms of happiness (engagement, job satisfaction) and health (strain) is not weakened in the context of telework. Nevertheless, we found differences in the importance of specific domains to foster happiness and health well-being. In terms of relational well-being, we found that WBHRM is positively related to social isolation in the telework and non-telework context (which is counterintuitive). We did not find support for any moderating effect through telework intensity.",art

Even though many studies have provided an in-depth understanding of how technology changed individual forms of modern work (e.g. virtual teams, shared leadership, remote work), the field needs a broader view of what constitutes technology-driven work arrangements and why they are implemented in organizations. The purpose of our paper is to systematically review, structure, and integrate the empirical evidence on current research on technology-driven work arrangements and to identify blind spots, which will serve as a springboard for the further development of the field. Based on our understanding of technology-driven work arrangements as flexible approaches to work within and beyond organizational boundaries that result from technology-driven transformation processes characterized by intensified spread, speed, and depth, we identify 191 studies that meet our inclusion criteria and organize them into six thematic clusters. We integrate our findings into an overarching framework based on complexity theory. We argue that three thematic clusters identified in our systematic literature review (organizational architectures across boundaries, knowledge integration processes across boundaries, and flexible employment relations across organizational boundaries) address an organization's need for external flexibility. In contrast, three other clusters (virtual teams within organizations, virtual communication processes within organizations, and enhancement of self-responsibility of organizational actors) address internal flexibility needs, reflecting the overall goal of technology-driven work arrangements to achieve internal and external flexibility via coordinated and consistent patterns of action across all clusters. We additionally highlight underexplored research opportunities and provide promising avenues for future research.",art

Cross-cultural training (CCT) is important for facilitating more effective interaction in a foreign country, yet theoretical development around CCT rarely captures modern-day migration trends, such as the refugee crisis. Building on the fact that refugees require extra cross-cultural support, as they rarely have sufficient time and resources to prepare pre-departure, we bring the humanitarian context to the field of international human resource management in general and to CCT literature in particular. Through a multidisciplinary review, we offer a theoretical model based on the capability approach to understand existing studies and guide future research. We especially examine the target social groups for CCT, the various components of the training, engagement by receiving community stakeholders, and the relationship of training to individuals' cross-cultural experiences in a foreign country. CCT is vital for refugees to rebuild their lives and careers in a way that enhances their substantive choices and freedoms to achieve what they value in their new country, and our review suggests scholarship has more work to do to reflect contemporary trends in its theorizing of CCT.",art

Repatriate turnover is a key challenge for Multinational Enterprises (MNEs). While MNEs expect to retain returning employees (i.e. repatriates) and to benefit from new knowledge and experience they bring back from international assignments, a number of studies identify high rates of repatriate turnover intentions. This paper draws insights from social exchange theory and psychological contracts. By using survey data from 221 repatriates from the U.S., the paper presents an empirical study of the antecedents of repatriate turnover. Our findings demonstrate that repatriate perceptions of recognition of foreign experience, involvement, team orientation, and application of knowledge, had a significant impact on turnover intention and this impact was felt through repatriate job engagement i.e. repatriate job engagement significantly mediated the influence of recognition of foreign experience, involvement, team orientation, and application of knowledge on turnover intention. While the study findings contribute to the theoretical underpinnings of the antecedents of repatriate turnover it also informs how MNEs can apply new strategies and initiatives that heighten repatriate retention rates and prevent knowledge slippage and the loss of highly valued people soon after they return from international assignments.",art

Emotional labour (EL) is garnering increasing attention due to the potential negative consequences on employees and organisations. This is especially prevalent with front-line healthcare workers, resulting in high occupational turnover intention. Our study examines the use of high-involvement work practices (HIWPs), supervisor support and resilience as support resources for front-line nurses' emotional labour and work engagement to mitigate occupational turnover intention among nurses in Australia. Data was collected via a nationwide survey of 2,984 nurses and midwives. A significant positive relationship was identified between EL and occupational turnover intentions, mediated by work engagement. The provision of HIWPs resources, supervisor support and individual resilience play an important role in 'buffering' the negative impact of emotional labour on work engagement and the occupational turnover intention of nurses. The key message of our study demonstrates that multi-level resources, organisational (HIWPs), relational (supervisor support) and individual (employee resilience) are important for mitigating the effects of emotional labour on occupational turnover intentions.",art

Although health is among the strongest predictors of retirement timing, organizational effects on this relationship are largely unknown. Based on the theory of work adjustment and socioemotional selectivity theory, this study explores the role of human resources practices in the relation between older employees' health and retirement intentions-specifically, their preferred retirement age and their intention to engage in late-career employment after being eligible for pension. Three groups of practices are distinguished: individual development practices (e.g. life-long learning and career development), practices tailoring the transition to retirement (e.g. phased retirement), and practices allowing to continue working in later life (e.g. individualized employment forms). We tested our model with multilevel data from 556 older employees and 661 managers from 101 organizations. Results suggest that healthy employees intend to retire later, if individual development practices are stronger pronounced in the organization. In addition, the positive relation between health and the intention to engage in late-career employment was stronger in organizations that provide more opportunities to continue working. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of retirement intentions and offer practical implications to shape later-life work to the benefit of both organizations and employees.",art

Although scholars have attempted to explore supervisor feedback as an antecedent of voice, the underlying mechanism remains under-explored. The current research addresses this critical issue from the perspective of conservation of resources theory by delineating how and when supervisor feedback influences employee voice from an energy perspective. Using dyadic data collected from 671 employees and their 218 direct supervisors in a retailer company, we found that supervisor favorable feedback increases employees' relational energy, which, in turn, promotes employee voice. Conversely, supervisor unfavorable feedback decreases employees' relational energy and inhibits employee voice. Furthermore, we found that leader-member exchange quality is an important boundary condition for the relationship between supervisor favorable feedback and voice via relational energy. These findings highlight the role of energy in the relationship between supervisor feedback and employee voice. They also present implications for management to improve supervisors' skills at providing feedback.",art

Although unattained work goals and tasks are often viewed by management as an undesired state, the present paper proposes that daily lack of closure can sometimes boost rather than block job performance. Lack of closure is defined as an employee state or subjective feeling whereby the tasks, goals, or projects of a working day remain incomplete. This state is hypothesized to positively relate to job performance for high trait-level employee reflexivity and high day-level employee mindfulness and to negatively relate to job performance for low reflexivity and low mindfulness. To test expectations, a diary survey study was conducted among 209 employees of different sectors. Results supported both hypotheses but with a different temporal pattern for each moderator: On the one hand, previous-day lack of closure negatively related to day-level performance for low employee mindfulness and positively related to day-level performance for high employee mindfulness. On the other hand, day-level lack of closure negatively related to same-day performance for low employee reflexivity and positively related to same-day performance for high employee reflexivity. Theoretical implications of the findings are discussed and practical recommendations are formulated about how employee reflexivity and mindfulness can be enhanced, for example, though workplace interventions.",art

Despite the increasing number of studies that address various types of developmental relationships and their outcomes, we still know little about the mechanisms through which these relationships affect career outcomes. We investigated the mediating role of academics' research productivity in the relationship between both developmental network quantity and developmental relationship, and career satisfaction. This study proposed a theoretical model for the aforementioned mechanism, and empirically tested it. Questionnaires were administered in-person to academics across eighteen universities in Turkey and 564 responses were received. Findings revealed that research productivity plays a significant mediating role in the relationship between developmental networks and career satisfaction. Results were evaluated for theoretical contributions and practical implications and discussed with regard to future research in the field.",art

In response, interviews were conducted with 26 Australian CEOs and senior leaders from the private, public, and non-profit sectors across many industries. Qualitative analysis of the interviews identified themes including viewing employee MH as an individual issue, awareness of implicit bias, creating a safe workplace, ignorance of employee MH and best practices, a belief in the value of caring, use of a broad array of programs, and institutional/contextual factors influencing employee MH. A tension-centered approach was used to understand the themes. Tensions found include privacy concerns and managerial ignorance as opposed to employees feeling free to disclose MH information and finding safety and compassion in responses to employee disclosure; that tension can lead to a cycle of ignorance feeding ignorance. Other tensions include whether the organization cannot or can help mental ill health and whether MH is an individual or social/organizational responsibility. Theoretical contributions include identifying potential overlap between various responses to tensions, and caveats regarding the ostensible superiority of one type of response (synthesis). Practical recommendations include the promotion of workplace cultures supportive of disclosure/compassion/safety, and developing metrics to monitor Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs).",art

Previous literature on professional employees argues that the quality of their work depends on both their organizational and professional commitment. Combining a target similarity and a cognitive approach to HRM, this study examines the mediating effects of these two variables on the relationship between HRM practices and intention to stay. Using a sample of 265 professional auditors working for certified public accountancy firms, we find that organizational commitment mediates the relationship between information-sharing, fair rewards and intention to stay, while the effect of autonomy and recognition is successively mediated by professional commitment and organizational commitment. Training has a direct effect on intention to stay. The implications of these results for the development of an HRM model linking professional employees' organizational and professional commitment, thereby providing the possibility of reconciling organizational efficiency and traditional professional ethics, are discussed.",art

The aim of this study was to investigate the risks of being bullied at work based on country of birth, and compared to natives. We used a representative sample of the Swedish workforce collected in the autumn of 2017 (n = 1856). The results showed a more than doubled risk of being bullied for the foreign-born. Coming from a culturally dissimilar country, the risk of becoming a victim of bullying was almost fourfold. The increased risk was only for person-related bullying, indicating a risk of being excluded from the social work environment. From a social identity perspective, foreign-born is a salient out-group easy to single out and with a predatory bullying origin they easily become the scapegoat of the group or just an easy target of frustration. There was a greater risk associated with self-labelling as bullied than with the behavioural experience method. Self-labelling could possibly be construed as a mix of exposure to bullying behaviours, and being discriminated against, making it a less suitable method when studying bullying for minorities. The study shows the importance of working with these issues. It severely affects both individuals and the organization in which the negative treatment is occurring.",art

The degree to which multinational enterprises (MNEs) standardize their global management practices results from the interplay between pressures on local adaptation and global alignment. Based on data from reward managers of foreign subsidiaries operating mainly in Europe, the present study examines MNEs' global reward management and influencing factors. Our results show that the impact of localization pressures varies between reward practices, remains stable between the different host countries, and is strongest for benefits. Alignment pressures are strong for all reward practices, remain stable between different home countries, and are strongest for performance-related pay. The degree of alignment and localization pressures is reflected in the extent to which subsidiary practices resemble those of HQs and local competitors. This study suggests to researchers as well as practitioners that global reward management is not a simple choice between standardization and localization; instead, it asks to make a distinction between different reward practices and employee groups such as senior and middle management, as well as operational employees, thereby contributing to a more differentiated understanding of global reward management.",art

Existing research has pointed to the multifaceted nature of contextual effects, and how they may differ qualitatively according to locale. This perspective article argues that a distinct and shared theme across this literature is much more than a recognition that many different sets of institutions and/or cultural features can make for viable alternative HRM models. We also consider whether or not MNEs seek to accommodate local realities or work to change them. Developing and broadening inquiry around these concerns may represent a solid way for researching IHRM in an age of polycrisis. Such understandings may be of great value in exploring the relationship between the present global polycrisis and HRM practice.

Felt accountability, the perceived expectation that one's decisions and actions will be evaluated and rewarded or sanctioned, is a key driver of human behaviour and impacts work-related outcomes such as unethical behaviour and job satisfaction. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the importance of low-status expatriates (LSEs), a vulnerable and neglected group, which is often employed under challenging working conditions in low-status occupations. In this paper, we explore how LSEs experience and manage accountabilities in their often-precarious working lives. We draw on 36 qualitative interviews with LSEs employed in Germany. The data were analysed using a directed content analysis method. Our findings highlight that while LSEs feel less accountable towards stakeholders within their organisation, they experience accountabilities from multiple stakeholders outside their organisation. We demonstrate that while LSEs consider work-related accountabilities, their key accountabilities are rooted in individuals' private lives and can lead to higher degrees of accountability intensity. This study provides unique insights into the importance of private life accountabilities and how these intersect with accountabilities at work. We offer a revised framework of accountability that includes private life as an important dimension to enhance its applicability to LSEs.",art

Intersectional studies have examined the impact of personal characteristics upon employment experience, but little attention has been given to specificities of the neurodiverse and the military veteran. Both may possess skills and abilities that are desirable but there are several negative stereotypes that impact the acquisition and retention of work. Additionally, talent sourcing practices by employers can favour neurotypical people with a civilian background. Adopting a multi-method approach, this study explores barriers to employment and how they are compounded at the intersection of being a neurodiverse veteran (NDV). We surveyed 232 people with a medically diagnosed condition and conducted 21 semi-structured interviews to explore NDVs' views about how the recruitment process and HR practices impact their employment relationship. Extant studies often depict the intersection of qualities to be disadvantageous for the populations studied, however, our research suggests that NDVs can have highly beneficial work capabilities. Our practical contribution includes the identification of key positive and negative aspects in the employment of NDVs and how organizations can refine their talent sourcing and management. Our theoretical contribution is made through a framework depicting the influences on NDVs' employment relationships and a set of propositions that illuminate the intersectionality of neurodiverse and military veterans at work.",art

Global mobility studies have focused on the repatriation of assigned expatriates in multinational organisations overlooking the difficulties that self-initiated expatriates (SIEs) face upon returning home prematurely. Recent converging global crises have demonstrated the precarious and challenging circumstances that SIEs confront when relocating abroad of their own volition without the security and support of an organisation. Applying a sensemaking lens, our qualitative study reveals that a global crisis's volatile and unpredictable nature triggers a sensemaking process for SIEs on whether to withdraw prematurely or remain on assignment. Specifically, we unpack how, in attempting to put structure on what was a highly complex, anxious, and stressful situation, SIEs engaged in a sensemaking process of enactment, selection, and retention in deciding whether to return home early. This process involved interpreting varying contextual cues and emotions in acute conditions, processing conflicting information from a nexus of sensegiving actors, and engaging retrospectively in reflexive frames. Our findings enrich existing work on the challenges of SIE repatriation by illuminating the utility of crisis sensemaking to understand how SIEs navigate premature withdrawal amid crisis conditions.",art

Novel insights emerge from the analysis of how interactions between HR managers, line managers (LMs) and employees result in effective implementation of HR practices. Drawing on the ability-motivation-opportunity (AMO) framework, the aim of the study is twofold. First, we investigate the extent to which HR department initiatives-classified into HR ability-enhancing, HR motivation-enhancing and HR opportunity-enhancing-increase LMs' perceived ability, motivation and opportunity to perform in human resource management (HRM). Second, we analyse the role of LMs' AMO on the effective implementation of HR practices assessed in terms of employees' satisfaction with HR practices. We collected data from the HR manager, the line manager and between two and five employees (in total 302 employees) in each of the 100 Spanish companies in our sample. Our results reveal that HR motivation-enhancing initiatives increase LMs' motivation; and HR opportunity-enhancing initiatives improve LMs' perceived ability, motivation and opportunity, and indirectly the effectiveness of HRM implementation. We also found that LMs' opportunity is a crucial factor in improving the effectiveness of HR practice implementation. Implications for research and practices are discussed.",art

Increasing globalization and cultural diversity have accentuated the importance of developing cross-cultural competencies like cultural intelligence (CQ).

This work argues that research and practice will benefit from expanding the operationalization of CQ development to include CQ reconceptualization and CQ measurement recalibration because these types of change are also integral to the CQ development process. This work highlights that by not examining the presence of CQ reconceptualization and CQ measurement recalibration before examining changes in mean CQ scores over time, scholars and practitioners could fail to recognize the presence of CQ development when it happens, create a threat to the substantive interpretation offindings, and further contribute to the inconsistent and conflicting research results.

Employee turnover (ET) is a major issue faced by firms in all business sectors. Artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning (ML) prediction models can help to classify the likelihood of employees voluntarily departing from employment using historical employee datasets. However, output responses generated by these AI-based ML models lack transparency and interpretability, making it difficult for HR managers to understand the rationale behind the AI predictions. If managers do not understand how and why responses are generated by AI models based on the input datasets, it is unlikely to augment data-driven decision-making and bring value to the organisations. The main purpose of this article is to demonstrate the capability of Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) technique to intuitively explain the ET predictions generated by AI-based ML models for a given employee dataset to HR managers. From a theoretical perspective, we contribute to the International Human Resource Management literature by presenting a conceptual review of AI algorithmic transparency and then discussing its significance to sustain competitive advantage by using the principles of resource-based view theory. We also offer a transparent AI implementation framework using LIME which will provide a useful guide for HR managers to increase the explainability of the AI-based ML models, and therefore mitigate trust issues in data-driven decision-making.",art

Skills-based volunteering programs are designed by organizations to enable their employees to donate their job-related skills and develop new ones, while making a positive difference in the community. Although skills-based volunteering is one of the fastest growing trends in corporate citizenship, we know little about how employees respond to it. Using interview data from a financial institution (volunteering managers, n = 2; employee volunteers, n = 27), we explored this research question: How do employees react when volunteering is framed as an avenue for learning? Our findings show that one-third of volunteers expressed anger or defensiveness and ultimately rejected the notion of learning from volunteering; two-thirds reacted with curiosity, using the interview process to make sense of what they learned. These two groups of volunteers reported different attributions about why their firm supports volunteering. Whereas the former group was cynical about their firm's motivations, the latter believed that the firm's intentions were altruistic. However, not all of the participants fit neatly into this pattern; for a minority, manager support for volunteering altered the relationship between attributions and acknowledgement of learning. The key contribution of this paper is a theoretical model that explains how employees respond when volunteering is framed as a forum for learning.",art

Drawing on in-depth interviews with HR managers from a variety of organizational contexts in Australia, our findings show that approaches to accommodating MHCs vary systematically across organizations, and that common approaches to accommodating employees with MHCs unintentionally stigmatize both employees with MHCs, and MHCs more generally. We identify two new forms of structural stigma, which we respectively label business-based structural stigma and care-based structural stigma, that stem from transactional and paternalist approaches to accommodating employees' MHCs.

Although human capital has been widely recognized as a valuable asset that helps firms to develop core competences to achieve competitive advantage, little is known about how HR (human resource) practices enhance employee capabilities in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Building upon the resource-based view of HRM (human resources management) and the proactivity literature, we explore the effects of the HR system as an integration of bundles of HR practices on employee capability and how employee proactivity helps explain this relationship in the SME context. Using survey data collected from 213 employees working in service SMEs in New Zealand, we applied partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) to test our hypothesis. The results show that the HR system in SMEs facilitates employee proactivity with this, in turn, enhancing employee job capability. Our findings suggest that the HR system, as a source of human capital, is important for SMEs to exploit. Specifically, our findings validate the notion that the HR system is beneficial to employee capability through facilitating a proactivity mechanism in the SME context. These findings yield both theoretical and managerial implications, which are discussed.",art

This article examines women's participation in long-term, short-term, rotational and commuter organisationally assigned expatriation. It explores the effects of assignment length, pattern and accompanied/unaccompanied status on career contribution and home/family life outcomes. This triangulated research draws upon e-mail correspondence with 71 current female expatriates to learn about assignment types undertaken and future assignment intentions; and in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 26 of these assignees, and 14 human resource professionals in two case study oil and gas firms. This research is set within the theoretical frame of rational choice which suggests that couples engage cooperatively in their division of labour to maximise lifetime earnings, with women prioritising home and family over career prospects. The research finds that long-term assignments enable women to maximise or achieve high levels of both career and family outcomes. Alternative 'flexpatriate' assignments provide lower quality career potential and familial relationships, leading to career and/or family compromise/sacrifice. A model is presented to explain women's assignment preferences in meeting career and family life objectives, extending rational choice theory into the expatriate context.

Even though several differences exist between co-operatives and capitalist enterprises, such as the democratic governance style of the co-operatives, both types of enterprises compete with each other. In this context, how can the co-operatives distinguish themselves from private enterprises? Based on the AMO bundles model (for Abilities, Motivation and Opportunity to participate) and on the three-component model of organizational commitment, this study collected data from 578 respondents of financial service co-operatives in eastern Canada. This research had two primary objectives. First, it seeks to examine if employees perceive a co-operative difference through HRM practices which influences their commitment. Second, it aims to evaluate the relations between HRM practices, employees' perception of a co-operative difference, and their organizational commitment through the influence of some socio-demographic variables. The main findings are that: (1) the employees perceived a co-operative difference through HRM practices that influenced their commitment; (2) the more the employees had work experience, the more they perceived a co-operative difference, and the more they displayed affective and normative commitment; (3) the higher the hierarchical status of the employees, the less they displayed calculative commitment; (4) the employees with union membership displayed lower affective and normative commitment.",art

Working from home (WFH) has accelerated in occurrence following social distancing measures directed at stemming the spread of Covid-19 globally. Using a sample of 41 in-depth qualitative interviews and measurement of the personality scores of the 41 interviewees, who are UK academics, using the IPIP test questionnaire, we explored how mandatory WFH impacts the boundary management of different academics based on their personality and the role of personality in their boundary-management approach to enhance work-life balance (WLB) during Covid-19. Our results suggest that mandatory WFH impacts academics differently depending on their personality, with academics high in conscientiousness and introversion (compared to their neurotic and extroverted colleagues) more suited to managing work and life domains to maintain a WLB while working from home. Building on boundary theory, we uncovered that while conscientious and introverted academics preferred and used integration as their boundary-management style, extroverted academics preferred segmentation in favor of family, but used volleying as a boundary-management style. Neurotic academics leaned toward our newly uncovered boundary-management style - quitter. Our findings suggest that the family circumstances of academics play an important role in their boundary-management styles. Overall, our study suggests relationships between personality and boundary-management styles and characteristics.",art

The global COVID-19 pandemic led many organizations and employees to abruptly adopt remote work. This remote work transformation has broadly encompassed individuals from a diverse range of backgrounds (e.g. ethnicity, gender) and job roles. A multi-level, conceptual model is developed that explores its potential dark side, particularly for women and ethnic minorities. Drawing on social vulnerability theory and the relational framework of diversity, this manuscript explores how disproportionate exposure to remote work, surveillance and disciplinary mechanisms, along with adverse job and wage loss, job insecurity, and psychological health impacts for women and ethnic minorities may potentially permeate their workplace interactions and stimulate interpersonal conflict. Moreover, this model incorporates these relationships within their broader social context, shaped by the legislative framework and shared cultural beliefs such as social difference codes. Nevertheless, this model elucidates how certain organizational approaches to diversity management can potentially alleviate these disproportionate outcomes. Theoretical implications, future research directions, and recommendations for policy and practice are highlighted.",art

Accountability systems are the core mechanisms by which workers are motivated and controlled. Sourced from customer ratings and powered by algorithmic control, the accountability systems of labor platforms are a substantial departure from those designed by human resources departments for use in traditional organizations. While considerable attention has been paid to the impacts of algorithmic control, it is ultimately a worker's felt accountability that influences their behaviors and attitudes in the workplace. However, to date, there has been an absence of theory that explains how labor platforms' accountability systems result in felt accountability. As such, our paper starts with an examination of the underexplored link between accountability systems and workers' felt accountability. We next argue that features of the accountability environment (source, intensity, salience, and focus) can be described both objectively and phenomenologically. We then make use of this distinction to detail the differences between the accountability systems of labor platforms and traditional organizations and theorize about resultant differences in workers' felt accountability. Finally, we discuss implications for the accountability and human resource management literatures, including the importance of the unexpected similarity between traditional workers' and platform workers' felt accountability.",art

This study examines the associations between flexible work arrangements (FWAs) and turnover intentions by testing four perspectives with consideration of the subprocess (i.e. indirect effects) that each conveys. Multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) was applied to test the direct, indirect, and total effects of flextime, telecommuting, and overall flexibility on turnover intentions (n1 = 1,505 employees, n2 = 64 work units). Support was found for the subprocesses that involved job control and work engagement. Flexibility was associated with more job control and work engagement which were in turn related to lower turnover intentions. That telecommuting was associated with higher work-to-family conflict and indirectly to higher turnover intentions raised questions about the net effects of flexibility. The discussion recasts the narratives that have guided research into the possible outcomes of work arrangements that provide flexibility.",art

In this paper, we shed light on how non-binary people express their gender identity in the workplace by drawing on self-discrepancy and self-verification theories. We argue that non-binary workers may experience a discrepancy between their actual and ideal expression of their gender identity at work and be motivated to prevent this due to a desire for others to see them as they see themselves. A mixed quantitative/qualitative survey of 160 non-binary workers in the UK and USA reveals that there are various ways non-binary workers express their gender identity at work via physical appearance and clothing, gestures and language, posture and movement, and other communication signals. However, most non-binary workers may perceive a moderate level of discrepancy between their current and ideal-future expression of their gender identity at work. We find that such discrepancies are less likely to occur when organizations promote supportive gender identity related HRM practices (such as flexible dress code and pronoun policies), co-worker allyship, and job autonomy. Overall, we contribute to knowledge about how non-binary people view their gender identity expression at work and what HR practitioners, managers, and co-workers can do to support them.",art

With this paper, we aim to challenge the current theorizing in talent management (TM) that has generally been based on oversimplified assumptions, often approaching TM from a binary or an either/or perspective. We claim that adopting a paradox lens in which a both/and perspective is taken is essential to further deepen our theoretical understanding of the ill-understood tensions and ambiguities that are inherently part of managing talent. In this article, we take a paradox perspective to unravel the complexity of talent management by systematically reviewing the nature and prominence of paradoxes and their response mechanisms in the talent management literature and from the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and organizational levels. We identified six primary paradoxes: (a) opportunities vs. pressures (at the intrapersonal level); (b) positive vs. negative effects of TM programs on employees (at the interpersonal level); and (c) talent as objective reality vs. socially constructed; (d) exclusiveness vs. inclusiveness; (e) transparency vs. ambiguity; and (f) standardization vs. customization (at the organizational level). Our review resulted in a multi-level framework of paradoxes in talent management and responds to calls for more pluralistic and balanced approaches to talent management. We believe that our review can assist researchers in adopting both/and perspectives when studying the complexity of the talent management phenomenon and can assist TM practitioners in navigating multiple paradoxes that are inherent to managing talent.",art

This paper sought is to provide a unique examination of what constitutes extreme work for the HR professional, and in turn the extent to which HR professionals are engaged in such work. Granter et al. (2019) multidimensional theoretical framework of work intensity (organizational, temporal, emotional and physical) challenges was used as an anchor to explore and understand these issues. The paper is based on a thematic analysis of interviews with Australian HR professionals capturing the nature, complexity and intensity of their role, and the implications on the HR professional, inclusive of those resulting from the dark side of HR. Granter et al. (2019) work intensity challenges (organisational, temporal, emotion and physical) were found to be intrinsic to the role of the HR professional; the complex and intense nature of the role further found to pose a risk to the HR professional's health and well-being, thus supporting the contention that HR is an extreme form of work. In establishing HR as a form of extreme work, this research offers a unique contribution that not only adds to the extreme work literature but also further supports the idea that work intensity is critical to the conceptualisation of extreme work.",art

Constructive employee voice is important but challenging to promote in high power distance contexts. The unique and relative importance of HRM systems and leadership in promoting it is more generally little understood. This study investigates the unique and relative importance of a high-performance work system (HPWS) and transformational leadership (TL) for constructive employee voice behavior, as well as how individual-level power distance orientation (PDO) moderates those relationships. The analyses are based on a sample of 403 subordinates of middle managers in 232 domestic Russian organizations. The results show that both TL and HPWS relate positively to employee voice, but most importantly that HPWS is more strongly so related, that it significantly substitutes the relationship between TL and voice, and that the relationship between HPWS and voice is further strengthened by employee PDO. We also conducted post-hoc qualitative interviews with 25 employees in domestic Russian organizations to triangulate our quantitative results. The study contributes to research on employee voice, in particular to research on the relative importance of its antecedents, and to the emerging body of research that simultaneously considers HRM and leadership.",art

Despite a growing interest in examining why and how variability within organizations develops throughout HR implementation, attempts hitherto appear futile. We evaluate that it is attributed to the with-organization level HRM research, overly skewed towards delineating the mediating processes. It is, as we argue, imperative to directly capture the sources and consequences of the discrepancy in the HRM-performance relationship to enrich our understanding of the phenomena and, more importantly, intervene more strategically in practice. To that end, we investigate how employee conscientiousness systematically changes the relationship between workgroup-level HR practices and employee affective commitment, subsequently conducive to task performance. Our analyses of time-lagged, multilevel data demonstrated that the indirect HRM-commitment-performance link turns significant only when the level of conscientiousness is factored in. Further, we found that motivation-enhancing HR practices are more effective for those low on conscientiousness, whereas high-conscientious individuals perform better under the influence of opportunity-enhancing HR practices. In our sample, the ability-enhancing HR bundle did not work together with conscientiousness either way. The current study is indeed a meaningful pursuit as one of the early attempts to draw a more nuanced picture of idiosyncratic employee responses.",art

This study empirically investigates the myopic behavior of the stock market toward firms' human capital resource investment, paying particular attention to two key proxies: human resource expenditure and the firm value added allocated to the employees. Focusing on human capital resource investment decisions' alignment with near versus longer-term emphasis by investors, we examine firms listed in the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 over a five-year period using an established accounting-based valuation model. Our results show that human capital investment discourse leads to overweighting of the forecasted longer-term earnings in the apportionment of share price constituents, suggesting that investors consider investment in employees to generate more return in the longer-term. Additionally, our findings prove that investors respond to firm level human capital resource as an investment generating more return in the longer-term. This emphasises the importance of communicating human capital resource investment information that accurately reflects the firm value creation via employees in external financial reporting.",art

This study focuses on distinctive themes of career success and their relationship with fundamental societal logics. Drawing on theoretical insights from neo-institutionalism, and adopting a mixed-method approach based on semi-structured interviews and questionnaire surveys with Chinese managers, we conducted a qualitative and quantitative study on the meaning of career success in a typical 'hybrid' society. In contrast with understandings of career success centred on market-based logics, our analysis highlights the complex, reflective relationship between career success themes and societal logics. The results indicate that among the identified career success themes, traditional logics and their market-based counterparts coexist, and are consistent with each other in some ways and conflicting in others. The results further show that the reflection of societal logics in derivative meanings, in contrast to that in core meanings, is more institutionally contextualised and, therefore, less consistent. Our study adds to the understanding of how social contexts shape the meaning of career success, and has important implications for career and human resource management research and practice.",art

This article is motivated by extant literature on how first-world countries, such as the UK, increasingly face problems with poverty arising from employment (in-work poverty). The main problem addressed by this article concerns making a clearer conceptual link between HRM philosophy and practice and in-work poverty. To address this conceptual problem, life history interviews (n = 27) were conducted with employees experiencing in-work poverty, due to their effectiveness at explaining why people get into low pay cycles. Based on a lens built through consulting literature on socially responsible HRM (SRHRM) and in-work poverty, the findings demonstrate a conceptual link between HRM philosophy and practice and in-work poverty, resulting in a proposed model of socially irresponsible HRM (SIHRM). We suggest that, negative and important employee outcomes from forms of SIHRM arise not just in the work setting, but also at the work-life interface. The article has implications in terms of informing a range of HRM and in-work poverty debates. Further research and the testing of the ideas generated through this article is recommended before concluding on the wider implications of a model of HRM based on social irresponsibility.",art

This research investigates why Indigenous workers decide to enter, stay or leave their positions in art centres that serve as important social enterprises in remote Australia. We develop a framework that integrates identity theory and push-pull theory via institutional logics, thereby extending Wry and York (2017)'s typology configurations that is applicable to other actors in the entrepreneurial eco-system, including Indigenous art centre workers. Based on a qualitative study of 72 Indigenous art centre workers employed in remote Australia, the results indicate that although art centres have dual for-profit and social missions, it is mainly pull factors related to paid, local employment aligned to vocational interests, and pro-social motives that are important in explaining why Indigenous Australians choose to work there. Career motives also explain workers' decision to stay, while diverse pull and push factors explain why workers quit. Importantly, the factors that explain employment decisions are multi-factorial, interrelated and closely tied to the social and cultural logics of community life. The research furthers our understanding of how identity factors contribute to decisions by Indigenous art centres workers to enter, leave or stay in their role, providing a more complete understanding of HRM within the context of social enterprises.",art

The present study focuses on the opportunity dimension of the ability-motivation-opportunity framework and explores the implications of autonomous work practice (AWP) for the collective turnover and productivity of firms. Given the trade-offs between the costs and benefits of AWP and its potential double-edged sword effects, we adopt the interdisciplinary perspective on job design (i.e. mechanistic and motivational models) as basis to theorize the curvilinear effects of AWP. We further hypothesize the interaction between AWP and work flexibility, consistent with the internal fit perspective of strategic human resource management. The current framework is validated by analyzing multisource, time-lagged data collected from 1,240 firms over a two-year period. The analysis confirms the hypothesized curvilinear effects of AWP, in which collective turnover is low only when the level of AWP is moderate. The detriment of a high level of AWP on increasing collective turnover is amplified for firms with low work flexibility. By contrast, firm productivity is high when the AWP level is either low or high, and the benefit of a high level of AWP on increasing productivity is pronounced for firms with high work flexibility.",art

Understanding and effectively responding to employee psychological contract (PC) breach is a critical task for human resource (HR) managers. Drawing on social information processing theory and the deontic theory of justice and using two separate studies, Study 1 (an experiment) and Study 2 (a two-wave field study), the study proposes and tests a conceptualization that helps to explicate the implications of PC breach from the perspective of the third-party employee. Specifically, supporting our hypotheses, we found that when a third-party observer perceives a coworker's PC breach perpetrated by their common focal supervisor that this negatively influences the third-party's perceptions of the supervisor's interactional justice (i.e., both interpersonal and informational) and that such a relationship is moderated by the extent of the third-party's guanxi with the supervisor. Moreover, our findings further reveal that when a third-party observer with high guanxi with the supervisor also has a high power distance orientation (PDO), that the negative effects associated with the perceived coworker PC breach will be weakened. The study not only responds to scholars' calls but it improves understanding of how the relational context may distort third-party perceptions of social treatment and justice-related behavior. Implications to theory, practice, and future research are discussed.",art

This paper develops a conceptual framework of language strategies in the cross-border post-merger and acquisition (M & A) context as firms seek legitimacy for integration from their internal stakeholders. We contribute by developing a framework for advancing the debate that cross-border bidder firms employ rationalistic and nationalistic rationales to legitimise their M & A choices, including the role of language, which is an embodiment of culture to help create synergies in a post-merger integration (PMI) context. Based on our review of social identity, legitimacy, and strategic integration literature, our conceptual model outlines language strategies to achieve the twin goals of PMI and legitimising their choices. We offer a critical review of the approaches used in cross-border PMI and integrate the role of language in gaining legitimacy for the internal stakeholders, such as its impact on employees and managers. From an international human resource management perspective, we highlight the importance of language strategies for each of the four integration scenarios for the bidder and target firm employees and managers, primarily when neither the target nor the bidder firm uses English as their native language. Finally, we develop propositions to advance future research in this area. The role of international language training and other approaches is also highlighted.",art

Assigned expatriates play a role in the innovations of multinational companies (MNCs). Yet, we still know little about how MNCs can help their expatriates towards being more innovative. In this study, we draw on conservation of resources theory to propose that perceived host country national (HCN) supervisor cultural intelligence (CQ), as a contextual resource, positively influences expatriates' innovativeness via two personal resource pathways. Specifically, we suggest that expatriates' work engagement and subsidiary socialization, as corresponding personal energy and personal knowledge pathways, positively mediate between perceived HCN supervisor CQ and expatriate innovativeness. We further hypothesize that expatriate cultural metacognition, as a key resource, helps expatriates utilize contextual resources more effectively to generate personal resources to innovate, and thus, it positively moderates the two mediation pathways. We use time-lagged data collected from assigned expatriates to test our hypotheses. We discuss our theoretical and practical contributions to the international human resource management literature.",art

Additionally, teachers are expected to be more creative in approaching their work which, it is argued, will improve performance at the school level. Nevertheless, little research has been conducted to understand how to enhance employee creativity, and whether creativity will improve the education sector's organizational performance. In addressing this gap, we conducted research in the education sector in China, collecting data from 59 public schools, over 1,000 teachers and just under 5,000 students. This multi-source dataset was analysed utilizing three-level structural equation modelling.

Employees' mental health issues present significant challenges for organizations globally. Despite various human resource management (HRM) interventions, systemic stigmatization of people with mental health challenges endures. We propose drawing on an innovative HRM practice in the mental health sector, by introducing designated lived experience (LE) roles into organizations to achieve cultural shifts that benefit the entire workforce. A sector-wide survey was conducted across the mental health sector within an Australian state. A whole-workforce approach was taken by seeking perspectives from employees in both LE roles and traditional roles. Complete responses were obtained from 327 participants (116 in LE roles and 211 in traditional roles). Results showed that across the entire workforce, top leader commitment to LE roles led to more clarity about LE roles, resulting in improved individual outcomes of authentic self-expression, and organizational outcomes of service delivery. LE role clarity was particularly important in organizational contexts where social integration of LE roles was low. Our study puts lived experience at the forefront of HRM scholarly debate, highlighting how employing LE roles can achieve better performance, diversity and inclusion outcomes especially for those with mental health challenges, and support the development of more healthy and inclusive organizations.",art

Recent scholarship has shown the prevalence of work-family conflict among social workers caused by their intense job demands. Correspondingly, academics and practitioners alike have recommended work-home segmentation as an effective coping strategy to help social workers deal with work-family conflict. Drawing on the stressor-strain-outcome framework, we first conducted Study 1 using a survey of 504 social workers to test psychological strain as a mediator of the relationship between work-family conflict and job performance, and to examine if work-home segmentation buffered the mediating relationship. Contrary to prior studies, work-home segmentation only alleviated work-family conflict for some social workers, but intensified the psychological strain and reduced the job performance of other social workers. To probe this finding further, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 social workers in Study 2 to understand why work-home segmentation did not reduce their psychological strain. The interviews revealed that most struggled to detach themselves psychologically and emotionally from work at home. The inability to implement work-home segmentation thus became an additional stressor, and they also engaged in after-hours work-related rumination. Therefore, we encourage organisations and managers to adopt a nuanced approach when advocating work-home segmentation as a coping strategy for frontline workers to deal with work-family conflict.",art

Despite redundancies having far reaching consequences for organisations, relatively limited attention has been paid to the conflicting experiences of those implementing the redundancy process; the redundancy envoys. By drawing on theories of cognitive dissonance and 'dirty work' we explain how individuals implementing redundancies can experience a disconnect between their outward and inner emotions. We reconceptualise redundancy envoys as quasi-dirty workers as they intermittently perform 'dirty work' tasks that may be perceived as morally tainted, whilst recognising their conventional role incorporates tasks perceived as contrary to that of 'dirty work'. Our study draws on insider research access to redundancy envoys over a five-year period during the implementation of four consecutive redundancy programmes, providing the opportunity to observe decisions and actions in 'real time.' We offer a contemporary reconceptualisation of the redundancy envoywhich permits a deeper understanding of the negative impact on redundancy envoys and offers opportunities to examine how this can be reduced. In addition, it is anticipated that the results of this study will offer support to HR functions in reducing the stigma of 'dirty work' for redundancy envoys with the intention of enhancing the management of redundancy implementation.",art

The COVID-19 crisis has caused a wave of redundancies globally. This has brought the organisational practice of downsizing into sharp relief. Responsible downsizing is broadly understood as the actions, practices and strategies adopted by organisations to ameliorate the negative effects of redundancy. The paper draws on HR theories of best practice and best fit to explore the phenomenon of responsible downsizing, as a dominant focus in extant literature is the identification of 'responsible' best practices. In challenging these prevailing assumptions, this paper contends that responsible downsizing is more usefully understood as theoretically underpinned by a best fit approach. While there is value in adopting best practices the paper argues that greater attention should be paid to how organisational, societal and institutional contexts shape their implementation. Based on a review of 44 empirical articles, the paper advances a framework for responsible downsizing. The framework establishes four types of responsibility: regulatory, procedural, communication and employment responsibilities. Critical areas for future research are also mapped along with conceptual and practical implications.",art

Interpersonal interactions of global employees are critical for Socio-Cultural Adaptation (SCA) and effective human resources management in the international environment. To date, research examining the impact of interpersonal process of conflict in effective socio-cultural adaptation in the global environment is limited. In this study, we argue that conflict is pervasive in interpersonal interactions and is likely to impact the success of global employees' SCA. We propose that employees' communication and cultural intelligence play important mediating and moderating roles in the link between conflict and SCA. Findings from 241 global organizational employees from over 30 countries suggest that conflict and communication are directly related to SCA. Additionally, aspects of employees' communication behaviors mediated the link between conflict and SCA, while aspects of cultural intelligence moderated the link between conflict communication behaviors and SCA. These findings extend the literature on SCA and contribute to the further development of the concept of cultural intelligence in relation to human resource management. The implications of our findings for international human resource management are discussed.",art

This study draws on data on dual apprenticeship training in Germany to investigate which factors determine how fast the decision to terminate an apprenticeship before its completion is taken and executed. Information on the speed of this process can help organizations improve their decision-making in taking measures aimed at preventing premature terminations. As the results of our probit regression show, the decision to terminate an apprenticeship early is likely to be implemented in less than two months if the sole initiator of the termination is the apprentice and the decision is made within the probationary period or during the first year of the apprenticeship. Our analysis also shows that dissatisfaction with the quality of training increases the probability of a swift termination. In contrast, when the reason is unsatisfactory performance on the part of the apprentice at the vocational school, the process of premature termination is likely to be significantly slower.",art

Increasingly, multinational companies (MNCs) are entering less explored markets with highly uncertain environments. In such an environment, MNCs must develop new solutions to tackle unpredictable changes. While there are some studies focusing on firm strategies in turbulent environments, there is a scant understanding of how the human resource strategies of MNCs should change in precarious environments. Thus, built upon the dynamic capability perspective, we focus on the human resource capabilities that MNCs develop in an uncertain emerging economy. In this research, we carried out a multiple case study and interviewed six MNCs' subsidiaries operating in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Our findings demonstrate that in an uncertain environment, human resource managers should be able to develop flexible cost management, adapt compensation packages, employ frequent and transparent communication, ensure retention of their top-quality managers, develop long-term oriented team-based and quick decision-making, and have the autonomy from MNC headquarters to enact these initiatives.",art

This paper examines the job seeking experiences of international graduates in attempting to obtain meaningful work in their university education host country. Qualitative feedback on the specific job seeking barriers and experiences in the host country after graduating were provided by 696 respondents. The findings suggest that the specific barriers to finding employment were their visa status, lack of work experience and perceived discriminatory practices of potential employers and/or their agents. The study also suggests that the discriminatory employment experiences of international university graduates demonstrate a lack of congruence between the concept of best fit in hiring decision making and a culturally diverse Australian labour market. Not only do the current practices limit the source of potential highly educated, skilled and culturally aware employees into the labour market of the host country, it also severely compromises an organisation's ability to achieve workplace diversity; a strategic outcome necessary to compete within a highly competitive global economy.",art

While there is a positive relation with severance payments after those dismissals which stem from plant closings, the incidence of a works council is negatively associated with severance pay subsequent to individual layoffs. In both cases, we find a negative moderating effect of individuals' higher re-employment chances. We also explore gender differences and differences between the types of previously held jobs.",art

In today's fiercely competitive market landscape, leader high performance expectations (LHPEs) are increasingly integrated into performance management practices in the workplace. However, this adoption may yield a performance management paradox: while some argue that high performance expectations prompt proactive employee engagement, others assert that such expectations induce withdrawal. Our study aims to unveil this paradox and its underlying mechanisms. Drawing upon insights from the HR attributions literature and the job demands-resources model, we propose that the impact of LHPE is contingent upon employees' attributions for this practice. Specifically, employees attributing LHPE to prosocial motives experience a sense of thriving at work, leading to increased engagement in proactive behavior (the motivational pathway). Conversely, those attributing LHPE to self-interest motives experience distress at work and tend to withdraw (the strain pathway). Our hypotheses are supported by the results of a three-wave survey involving 321 employees. Overall, our findings underscore the crucial role of employee attributions in implementing LHPE as a performance management strategy, offering insights into its optimal utilization.",art

Psychological contract theory has largely neglected the role of previous experience. In this study, we examine how previous work experience influences outcomes of communication with organizational insiders during organizational socialization among healthcare staff. We develop a model based on signalling theory, within which information acquisition during socialization is associated with psychological contract fulfilment, which is in turn is related to better health, happiness, and social relationships. Moderated mediation analysis based on data collected at entry and three months later confirms indirect effects between three types of information acquisition and three employee outcomes via the mediating role of psychological contract fulfilment. Importantly, these indirect effects are present only for inexperienced newcomers. Our findings build on signalling theory and add to knowledge about how the psychological contract forms during early socialization. They also suggest that organizations should pay particular attention to inducting inexperienced newcomers.",art

Empirical findings concerning the effects of extrinsic rewards on employee creativity have been controversial and have focused mainly on the theoretical mechanism of intrinsic motivation. Although intrinsic motivation is a primary impetus for creativity, generating creative outputs is a process that requires a sequence of creative endeavors. Drawing from the componential theory of creativity, this study proposes a positive relationship between extrinsic rewards and creativity via creative process engagement. Additionally, two types of employee characteristics, i.e. person-job fit and cognitive flexibility, are important contingency factors affecting the reward-creativity relationship. Our empirical analyses of data collected from 228 supervisor-subordinate dyads demonstrate the mediating role of creative process engagement in the reward-creativity relationship. Moreover, employees with high levels of person-job fit and cognitive flexibility are found to have the highest levels of creative process engagement and, in turn, the greatest creativity when motivated by extrinsic rewards for creativity. These findings have several theoretical and managerial implications related to reward-creativity research and practice.",art

Extending the discourse on impression management, we explore a counter-intuitive workplace deviance phenomenon whereby employees aim to get themselves fired from their jobs. Employing exploratory qualitative methods, we collected evidence from employees who practice deliberate negative impression management (NIM), from parties who witnessed NIM, and from Human Resource (HR) managers who have dealt with NIM, in two distinct geographies: Israel and Taiwan. The paper outlines the diverse sources of NIM, its specified and unspecified aims, its actual consequences, and its prevalence.

We aimed to understand how nonbinary individuals cope with gender identity threats in different contexts at work. We used a grounded theory approach through semi-structured interviews with 28 nonbinary Brazilian individuals from 25 organizations. In environments that are threatening to their gender identity, nonbinary individuals adopt a trial-and-error process of gender identity expression that makes them realize that restructuring their identity leads to a high sense of inauthenticity, while preserving it incurs high social costs. As both are unsatisfactory, some of them adopt ambiguous responses that allow them to find ways to make identity claims through performative processes of gender identity expression. Such a process, although not fully reflecting their desire for authenticity, provides satisfactory validation. This mechanism is possible when they interact in other environments where their identity claims are validated. Thus, the gender identity expression validated in more receptive contexts allows these individuals to experience what we named as cross-context identity enactment. It is a process by which the social validation that individuals obtain by enacting an identity in a less-threatening context allows them to rely less on validation in a more threatening context to retain such identity in their self-concept.",art

Contemporary research has focused on antecedents, incidences, and consequences of workplace violence in the healthcare sector. However, little is known about the role of HRM in supporting healthcare workers to cope with negative emotions arising from workplace violence. Grounded in the conservation of resources theory, this study examines the moderating effects of wellbeing HRM practices (WBHRM) on the relationship between workplace violence and job stress. We also examine the mediation effects of job stress on the relationship between workplace violence and quality of care. Data were gathered from 254 and 225 (Study 1) aged care workers (nurses and personal care assistants) in Australia and 136 healthcare workers (doctors and nurses) in China (Study 2) across multiple waves. We use a new measure of WBHRM in this paper to test our hypotheses. Results show that the presence of WBHRM practices moderated the relationship between workplace violence and job stress. We also found that job stress mediates the relationship between workplace violence and quality of care. The findings contribute to the HRM literature by providing an innovative WBHRM approach to support health care workers to cope with job stress after they experience workplace violence.",art

Multiple language use in multinational corporations (MNCs) crossing linguistic boundaries can lead to code-switching and the creation of hybrid languages. Hybrid languages in MNCs can facilitate or impede organizational processes. The source of such ambiguous findings may lie in individuals' attitudes toward hybrid languages. The sociolinguistics literature suggests that language attitudes impact individuals' in- and out-group behavior and may explain mixed findings of hybrid language use. We conduct research in the context of MNC-tone-a hybrid English-Chinese language popular in MNCs in China, which has also spilled into Chinese society among non-MNC workers. We examine the attitudes of Chinese nationals toward MNC-tone, the geo-social antecedents that contribute to attitude formation, and the consequences of such attitudes on perceived organizational attractiveness and interpersonal guanxi (informal and positive relationship between individuals facilitating processes in organizations). With survey data collected from Chinese employees in two interconnected studies (N = 342 and 502), we find that individuals from a multilingual landscape with access to foreign media and a multilingual social network have positive attitudes toward the hybrid language. Individuals with positive attitudes are likely to be attracted to work in MNCs that use the language and exercise interpersonal guanxi with others that use the hybrid language.",art

Middle-managers are vital catalysts for organizational innovation, acting as a bridge between organizational strategy and goals set by senior-managers and the actions of lower-level employees. Their proactive motivation to engage in innovative work behavior is therefore central to organizational endeavor. However, the innovation literature is replete with studies focusing solely on organizational-level determinants of middle-managers' innovative behavior while the HRM literature focuses predominantly on the experiences of lower-level employees. Little is known about the psychological factors and processes which give rise to middle-managers innovative work behavior. Drawing on the proactive motivation model, this study examines whether middle-managers' personal initiative mediates the relationship between the four dimensions of their psychological empowerment and their innovative work behaviors. Drawing on a sample of 110 middle-manager-supervisor dyads, our study highlights personal initiative as the mechanism through which psychological empowerment influences innovative work behaviors. Our work further informs the HR literature about how HR practices and systems may be used to foster middle manager proactivity in the workplace. In total, our study seeks to take a step towards reducing the dearth in knowledge on the psychological determinants of middle-managers' innovative work behaviors.",art

Knowing how employee work engagement can be fostered in the firm is therefore a subject of great interest to both academics and managers, but few studies have examined how organisational interventions positively affect employee work engagement. In this research, we focus on the relevance of organisations' human resource management to promote high levels of engagement among their employees. The theoretical framework guiding our research, Kahn's (1990) model, provides interesting insights into the mechanisms through which human resource management influences employee work engagement. By testing a multilevel model based on matched data from a sample of 146 HR managers and 504 employees in Spanish companies, our analyses show that high performance work systems have a positive influence on work engagement through the employee psychological conditions of meaningfulness, psychological safety and psychological availability.",art

Drawing on data from 242 Chinese expatriates based in 25 different countries/regions, we employ multilevel analyses to test the research hypotheses related to expatriate talent management. The results of this exploratory study confirm that motivational cultural intelligence has a positive and significant effect on cultural adjustment: work adjustment, general adjustment and interaction adjustment respectively, and cultural distance has a negatively moderating role between motivational cultural intelligence and work adjustment of expatriate talent.

In-depth interviews with 30 informants illustrate trickle-down effects of trust from the national level to the organizational and individual levels shaping processes, outputs, and interactions of PA. While German informants expressed trust in the overall PA practice of the US-headquarter, French informants reacted with mistrust to PA manifested in different processes, rater and ratee attitudes, outcomes of PA, as well as the role of HR.

We assessed the financial value of human resource management (HRM) as a function of obtaining more star performers. Specifically, we implemented utility analysis procedures on 206 samples of individual performance (i.e. output) encompassing 824,924 workers. We found that HRM adds greater financial value by obtaining more stars. Our results also offer several specific contributions to HRM theory. First, regarding how HRM produces greater value by obtaining more stars, our evidence points to a nonlinear model of HRM's value, where HRM generates significant yet diminishing returns by increasingly obtaining the most productive ones. Second, regarding when, our results show that diminishing returns from HRM are stronger when output differences among top stars are relatively small. Third, regarding why, our study explains that small output differences among top stars may create various costs which diminish the returns from obtaining the most productive stars. Our explanation of HRM's nonlinear pattern contributes to the star literature by helping integrate a variety of specific explanations for stars' curvilinear influence discussed in past research. Regarding HRM practices, we highlight the need to use utility analysis procedures that more fully consider the existence of stars.

In the aftermath of global warming, organizations are coming under increasing pressure to reduce carbon emissions, minimize waste, and generally become more responsible in their practices. To this backdrop, researchers argue that organizational HR practices have significant potential in shaping human behaviors. Therefore, by investigating the employment of a subordinate-supervisor dyad (N = 378 (subordinates), and 141 (supervisors)), this empirical study contributes to the growing literature on Green Human Resource Management (green HRM) and its impacts on employees' green outcomes. In particular, this study tested a novel model to explore the impact of green HRM on Green Creativity (GC) of employees in mediating the role of Pro-Environmental Behaviors (PEBs) and moderating the role of Ethical Leadership Style (ELS). Data were collected from organizations in the Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) region of Pakistan. For testing the results of the proposed hypotheses, structural equation modelling technique using SMART PLS 3 was employed. The results indicate that green HRM has a positive impact on employees' GC. Furthermore, partial mediating role of PEBs was also found. Finally, it was found that the ELS moderates the relationship between green HRM and GC and between green HRM and PEBs. Several theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",art

Previous research has shown that virtual work provides benefits to individual employees (e.g. less stress, higher job satisfaction, and higher productivity), the organization (e.g. lower real estate costs and higher commitment and performance) and, potentially, society at large (less traffic, less pollution, and lower healthcare costs through reduced stress and work-family conflict). To realize the potential benefits associated with virtual work, many organizations have introduced new policies to enable employees to work virtually. However, research evidence and media reports indicate that many employees are hesitant to utilize the opportunity to work virtually. To better understand this gap between formal organizational policies and actual adoption, we investigate the predictors and conditions of virtual work adoption. Drawing on Lewin's field theory and Bandura's social cognitive theory, we examine the extent to which virtual work self-efficacy, virtual work climate, and their interaction predict individual adoption of virtual work arrangements. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a survey study of 256 employees from a multinational information technology company. Our results suggest that an effective virtual work climate encourages employees with low virtual work self-efficacy to engage in more virtual work.",art

Employment trends see work and personal life domains becoming both more integrated (e.g. flexible working) and more segmented (e.g. global careers). Trends toward more extreme segmentation or integration may lead to a greater risk of misfit between employee preferences for and organizational supplies of integration/segmentation. This paper investigates the impact of organizational fit and misfit within a highly segmented occupational context: offshore work. With lengthy rotations away from home, followed by long periods away from work, limited inter-role communications and reduced day-to-day transitions between work and non-work roles, offshore work offers a segmented work-life interface. Fit and misfit of integration-segmentation preferences with perceptions of organizational integration-segmentation supply were examined among offshore employees, as well as their counterparts working traditional, office-based schedules. Using polynomial regression and response surface analysis, the impact of fit and misfit on work-life conflict, enrichment and organizational commitment was assessed. The data show that misfit resulting from an oversupply of segmentation may result in behavioral work-to-life conflict, associated with the reduced number of transitions between work and home roles, strain-based conflict, and a reduced transfer of resources from work to home resulting in less developmental work-life enrichment and organizational commitment. These findings contribute to existing literature by identifying the impact of misfit resulting from segmentation oversupply on individual and organizational outcomes, emphasizing the need for HR practitioners to recognize the potential for and impact of different forms of misfit within the changing landscape of their own organizational environments.",art

The aim of the present study, based on the framework of social exchange theory and sustainability, is twofold: first, to show how distinct employment relationships (ERs) can have different effects on sustainability outcomes; and second, to demonstrate how such an impact is mediated by the strength of the HRM system. The proposed model was tested using the multivariate method of partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) on a sample of 206 companies in the chemical and metallurgical industries. Data were collected via a questionnaire composed of measurement scales previously validated in the reference literature. Each company's production and HR managers were asked to complete the questionnaire. Our results showed that mutual investment ERs can indeed produce better sustainability results, and organisations with quasi-spot contract (QSC) relationships are unable to achieve sustainable organisational outcomes. The results also confirmed that a strong HRM system reinforces the positive effects of mutual investment ERs. Moreover, a strong HRM mitigates the negative effects of QSCs. In essence, our paper shows that the strength of an HRM system is a major driver of sustainability. Therefore, when implementing working relationships, managers should foster shared perceptions of the firm's values among its employees, thus clearly defining which behaviours are expected and rewarded.",art

Unraveling the intricate ties between top management, human resource management, and firm innovation is crucial in today's dynamic business landscape. The role of firm ownership is particularly vital in understanding these processes, especially within the context of increasingly diverse ownership structures. This study leverages the signaling theory and the upper echelon theory to investigate the direct and indirect impacts of top management (TM)'s strategic human resource focus (SHF) on firm innovation and improvement (FII). We investigate the moderating effect of firm ownership structures (state-owned enterprises and privately-owned enterprises) and the mediating effect of a high-performance work system (HPWS) in these processes. Findings reveal that TM's SHF has both a positive direct effect and a positive indirect effect on FII through the implementation of HPWS. The study affirms the moderating influence of firm ownership on the relationship between TM's SHF and HPWS, as well as on the mediating effect of HPWS in the relationship between TM's SHF and FII. Our analysis also uncovers distinct patterns in how firm ownership moderates the direct and indirect effects of TM's SHF on FII. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",art

This paper explores the exchange relationship between older conservation volunteers (aged over 50 years) and paid group organisers. Using qualitative interview data from seventeen adult volunteers and four organisers recruited from three conservation groups in the North West of England we argue that the psychological contract is important for understanding how organisations can manage and retain volunteers. Our findings highlight the importance of the psychological contract between volunteers and the group organiser, with each party recognising the mutual benefits they bring to the relationship. Participants' accounts revealed that they chose to take on the often physically challenging conservation work because the natural environment was important to them, but also because there was no obligation for them to attend. Thus, being a conservation volunteer allowed them to retain control over their voluntary time commitment and avoid the pressures of responsibility associated with having people depending upon them. At the micro-level, organisers appreciated the expectations and abilities of individual volunteers, managing and adjusting their own practices accordingly to encourage volunteer retention. We consider the implications of our research in terms of both volunteer and psychological contract theory and discuss the potential implications for organisations in terms of managing and retaining older volunteers.",art

This research explores the micro-level experiences of women with eldercare responsibilities in academia. We present academia as a site of extreme work and a gendered space. The 'ideal academic' is predicated on neoliberal logic, where long hours, uninterrupted career paths, and being care-less in terms of responsibilities are rewarded. Our study is set within the Irish Higher Education (HEI) sector where we undertook in-depth interviews with female academics who have eldercare responsibilities. Our findings reveal eldercare as an 'invisible' form of care, while research, arguably a substantive performance metric in academia was also experienced as an invisible pursuit taking place outside normal working hours. The interplay between these two invisible forces had disastrous consequences for women during the pandemic, as they attempted to respond to the intensification of elder care needs while extreme work in academia became normalised and research metrics continued to be a key measure of excellence, regardless of context. Our findings highlight the need to reshape the identity of the 'ideal academic' and dismantle the link between intense work patterns and success. Equally, the recalibration of HR policies, and performance metrics, to support staff with care responsibility emerged as vital in ensuring a sustainable academic workforce.",art

Organizations may hire newcomers as a source of creativity, bringing fresh ideas and novel solutions to benefit organizational performance. However, the conditions that foster newcomer innovation are not well understood. Drawing on behavioral plasticity and cue consistency theories, we investigate the combined influence of new job self-efficacy and two work design factors (work autonomy and work demands) affecting how supervisor creativity expectations (SCEs) translate into newcomers behaving innovatively. Two-wave data were collected from 108 graduates of a university in China. Results using reliability-corrected single indicator latent moderated structural equation modeling (RCSLMS) supported our hypotheses. Thus, SCEs predicted newcomer innovative behavior more strongly for newcomers with low new job self-efficacy. Moreover, supporting cue consistency theory, newcomers who perceived high SCEs and low new job self-efficacy demonstrated the highest level of innovative behavior when work autonomy was high or work demands were low. These results broaden the application of behavioral plasticity theory for understanding newcomer behaviors. Further, our findings emphasize the importance of consistent work environment cues to encourage newcomer innovation.",art

Robots are increasingly used in a variety of work environments, but surprisingly little attention has been paid to how robots change work. In this comparative case study, we explore how robotization changed the work design of order pickers and order packers in eight logistic warehouses. We found that all warehouses robotized tasks based on technological functionality to increase efficiency, which sometimes created jobs consisting of 'left-over tasks'. Only two warehouses used a bottom-up approach, where employees were involved in the implementation and quality of work was considered important. Although the other warehouses did not, sometimes their work design still benefitted from robotization. The positive effects we identified are reduced physical and cognitive demands and opportunities for upskilling. Warehouses that lack attention to the quality of work may risk ending up with the negative effects for employees, such as simplification and intensification of work, and reduced autonomy. We propose that understanding the consequences of robots on work design supports HR professionals to help managing this transition by both giving relevant input on a strategic level about the importance of work design and advocating for employees and their involvement.",art

China experienced an unprecedented increase in labor strikes until the mid-2010s, and the country continues to experience considerable strike activity. Therefore, it is important to study what predicts Chinese workers' attitudes toward strikes. The study applies social exchange theory as an overarching framework to investigate the contributions of three forms of social exchange relations in organizations-employee-employer relations, labor-management relations, and leader-member relations-to account for Chinese employees' attitudes toward strikes in multinational corporations (MNCs) based in China. Using a matched employee-employer sample of more than 1,600 employees in 41 China-based MNCs, the results obtained from hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analysis show that individual-perceived employee-employer relations indicated by a negative reciprocity norm is positively related to employees' strike attitudes. Labor-management relations indicated by the organizational-level cooperative industrial relations (IR) climate is negatively related to employees' strike attitudes. Leader-member relations indicated by leader-member exchange (LMX) is not significantly related to employees' strike attitudes. Overall, the results indicate that at the individual level, it is more important for companies not to do bad (to engage in negative reciprocity with workers) than to do good to reduce employees' strike attitudes.",art

The present study develops and tests an overreaching theoretical framework based on social exchange theory to examine the situations under which individuals with high levels of psychological entitlement are more or less likely to exhibit positive work attitudes and behaviors. In particular, we integrate perspectives from the team climate literature to analyze the moderating effects of employee involvement climate at the workgroup level on the relationship between psychological entitlement and organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) through the mediating mechanism of affective commitment (a first-stage moderated mediation model). To test our hypotheses, we collected data from 231 supervisor-subordinate dyads across 41 work teams at a large Chinese automobile manufacturer. We find that when the employee involvement climate level is high, the effects of psychological entitlement on OCBs through affective commitment are positive and significant. In contrast, when the employee involvement climate level is low, the relationship is negative and significant. The present study makes a theoretical contribution to the literature by examining the frequently neglected positive side of psychological entitlement. It demonstrates that a high employee involvement climate helps to engage psychologically entitled employees by circumventing previously unbalanced social exchange relationships. We also discuss the practical implications of our findings and provide suggestions for human resource managers to maximize the contributions of entitled employees and foster their organizational commitment and OCBs.",art

The purpose of this paper is to provide a mediation explanation of the relationship between HRM and nurse work engagement. The study contributes to understanding how high involvement work practices (HIWPs) relate to nurse work engagement by analysing the mediating role played by job crafting. The study also considers the importance of supervisor support as a moderator in the mediated relationship. The study was based on an anonymous online survey of 2,984 nurses employed in Australia. Analysis confirms the hypothesised relationships in that job crafting was found to mediate the positive relationship between HIWPs and work engagement. Further, supervisor support moderated the indirect relationship between HIWPs and work engagement through job crafting, such that the indirect effect was stronger under increasing levels of supervisor support. The results have implications for the importance of HIWPs on job crafting for nurses who carry out many professional roles simultaneously. Furthermore, the research highlights the role that supervisors play in encouraging and managing nurses who take advantage of HIWP opportunities to shape, mould and redefine their jobs.",art

The aim of this article was to examine the experiences of people with disabilities relating to job application forms and advertisements, interviews, confidentiality and disclosure of disability, as well as medical and psychometric testing. Qualitative data on the barriers experienced were obtained from semi-structured interviews with 72 people with differing disabilities in South Africa. Findings showed that despite progressive legislation, people with disabilities experience barriers in the integration phase of employment. To prevent barriers to employment, advertisements, application forms, interview venues and interview questions need to be accessible and appropriate for people with disabilities. In addition, the selection criteria and medical and psychometric testing used need to be appropriate and non-discriminatory. Insights from this qualitative article can assist in preventing employment integration barriers. This in turn will have an influence on human resource managers' hiring of people with disabilities, employers' meeting their employment equity targets, being viewed as an employer of choice who values diversity and having productive employees and a low staff turnover.",art

This study analyzes how flexible work practices (FWPs) such as flexible work schedules, telecommuting, and sabbaticals affect the organizational attractiveness of companies to job seekers in the German job market. We apply conservation of resource theory to propose that FWPs are positively related to perceived organizational attractiveness. Furthermore, we use organizational support theory to suggest that this link is mediated by job seekers' anticipated organizational support. We test our predictions using two complementary studies among German job seekers: A field study (N = 188) at two job fairs and an online scenario experiment (N = 469). Our findings indicate that flexible work practices, in particular flexible work schedules and sabbaticals, significantly increase organizational attractiveness as perceived by job seekers and that these effects are indeed mediated by anticipated organizational support. Our results further suggest that this link is independent of job seekers' attitudes towards FWPs and that the effect of sabbaticals is stronger than the effect of either flexible work schedules or telecommuting.",art

The purpose of this study is to identify the soft skills, relevant to the future talent pool in the information technology (IT) sector. Further, the study aims to investigate soft skills gaps among students which are hampering the availability of talent. Soft skills traits were first identified through a literature review. Then, using a structured questionnaire, we surveyed 269 IT professionals working in five IT companies and 329 students pursuing degrees in the IT/CS from 12 technical institutes. The analysis was performed using principal component analysis and an independent t test. We examined important soft skills such as personal traits, leadership, interpersonal skills, team skills, enterprising skills, and organizational skills. The independent t test results showed a perception gap between professionals and students regarding the importance of soft skills. This study contributes to the literature by adding to the understanding of critical soft skills in IT sector. It underlines the partnership between educational institutions and the IT industry to address this gap. This partnership will benefit all stakeholders. We argue that although talent management is dealt with at the industry level, academia play an important role in making this process easier and effective by developing the desired skills in students.",art

The significant influence of green human resource management (GHRM) on a firm's environmental performance (EP) has garnered considerable attention in recent literature. Research on GHRM has primarily focused on its impact on employee green behavior or outputs, neglecting its role as an organizational-level resource in facilitating the implementation of environmental strategy (ES). Additionally, limited attention has been paid to the influence of green consciousness (GC) of top managers on this process. Drawing on the resource-based view and upper echelons theory, this study employed a moderated mediation model to explore the relationships among ES, GHRM and GC of top managers. Data were collected from questionnaire responses of 476 senior executives from Chinese warehousing or logistics firms, gathered in three phases using a time-lagged approach. Results indicated that GHRM partially mediates the relationship between ES and EP. Additionally, it was found that GC of top managers moderates the relationship between ES and GHRM, acting as a boundary condition for the mediating effect of GHRM on EP. The study concludes with a discussion of several theoretical and practical implications arising from these findings.",art

This study is motivated by the infancy of literature on strategic HRM in regard to government policies and the lack of empirical research on the HRM policy of nationalization in the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). As such, it adopts a process oriented strategic HRM perspective through developing and examining an integrative framework of the antecedents and outcomes of the quality of the implementation of the Qatarized workforce in Qatar. This framework is informed by three aspects of the strategic planning process, namely, formulation, implementation, and evaluation, as determinants of the quality of implementation of the Qatarization strategy and how the latter, along with the three sets of strategic planning variables, influence the success of this strategy. In surveying 313 managers from organizations in Qatar, the study contributes to several streams of the literature: strategic HRM, nationalization, and strategic management, where the findings show that the implementation quality of Qatarization strategy is shaped by all three as aspects of the strategic planning process and that the success of this strategy cannot adequately be targeted without such an integrative perspective. However, the findings also suggest that the three aspects do not contribute equally to the success of this strategy. These findings entail several implications for managers, including the importance of paying heed to the comprehensive concept of integrative strategic planning in general, and the important role that formal planning plays when ensuring the success of publicly mandated HRM strategies.",art

This study investigates how global talent management (GTM) contributes to host-country national (HCN) knowledge sharing. Drawing from the social exchange, social identity, and attribution theories, we developed a theoretical model to examine how GTM influences HCN knowledge sharing via increased organizational identification and the moderating role of GTM climate strength in foreign subsidiaries. The survey results from 744 HCNs working for 28 foreign subsidiaries in South Korea demonstrate that HCNs' perceived GTM enhances their knowledge sharing by increasing organizational identification. A cross-level interaction analysis further suggests that GTM climate strength facilitates a positive relationship between GTM perceptions and HCN knowledge sharing, emphasizing the effect of consistency between the perceived GTM of employees and that of employers.",art

Despite increasing calls for context-specific and practice-based strategic human resource management research in emerging economies, to date there have been limited empirical studies on Nigeria, one of Africa's largest economies and a newly emerging economy experiencing strong economic development, rapid industrialisation, and integration into global markets. This study explores the moderating influence of contextual factors on the nexus of competitive strategy (CS) and human resource management practices (HRMPs) in Nigeria. We employ the social and comparative institutional theories to address the moderating influence of the contextual factors on the CS-HRMP nexus using a qualitative research approach. Data were collected from thirty human resource management professionals and top management across medium-sized enterprises in Nigeria via semi-structured interviews. The resulting data were analysed through thematic analysis. We establish six main contextual factors-culture and value system, religion, ethnicity and linguistic affinity, economic factors, politics and governmental policies, and quality of education and low-skilled workforce-and the processes through which these factors influence the CS-HRMP nexus in Nigeria.",art

Workplace mistreatment is common in healthcare, especially among nurses, who may experience mistreatment from different sources, yet must carry out essential, public-facing duties. However, researchers have typically studied forms of mistreatment in isolation. This paper investigates the combined relationship between abusive supervision (i.e., vertical mistreatment) and workplace bullying (i.e., horizontal mistreatment) on job satisfaction and public service motivation among nurses. Drawing from self-determination theory, we examine how experiencing workplace mistreatment can thwart the fulfilment of psychological needs, operationalised as job satisfaction. Experiencing workplace bullying alongside abusive supervision is predicted to worsen this relationship. In turn, nurses are less likely to internalise their organisation's values, leading to less public service motivation. We tested our hypotheses on 219 Australian public sector nurses via an online survey, with a temporal separation of six weeks. Results suggest that abusive supervision has an indirect negative association with public service motivation, via job satisfaction. Workplace bullying moderated the indirect relationship at high and low levels, though the indirect relationship was stronger at low levels. Our study contributes to a well-rounded understanding of workplace mistreatment, particularly within the context of self-determination theory, and to our understanding of how public service motivation is affected by employees' social environment.",art

This study utilises both evolutionary resource-based view (EBRV) and open systems theory to investigate the long term impact of high-performance work practices (HPWPs) on labour productivity in UK manufacturing and service sector SMEs. We investigate both forward and reverse causality and the moderating role of owner-manager strategic orientation, and whether such relationships are influenced by firm size and age. Utilising a longitudinal data set (a balanced panel) comprising 284 UK SMEs and six waves of data collection over a ten-year time period (2007-2017), we found support for both forward and reverse causality. Prior investments in HPWPs were positively associated with subsequent firm labour productivity and prior labour productivity was positively associated with future investment in HPWPs. The size of the estimated coefficients for these relationships were consistently larger for small firms than for medium sized firms, however there were not significant for firm age. We additionally found that owner-manager strategic orientation towards HR moderated both forward and reverse causality relationships and that this relationship increased over time. The size of the estimated coefficients was larger in small firms compared to medium-sized firms. Overall, our findings support calls to investigate both forward and reverse causality and to better understand potential differences between small and medium sized firms.",art

10.1080/09585192.2021.1960584,"The role of context in overcoming distance-related problems in global virtual teams: an organizational discontinuity theory perspective. Working at a distance has become a hot topic since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. One type of work unit that naturally faces both physical and social distance is the Global Virtual Teams (GVT). While distance has been debated in the GVT literature, there is still a scarcity of research on how to deal with distance related problems. Guided by organizational discontinuity theory, we explore the effect of individual-level approaches to overcoming physical distance (time zone adjustment) and social distance (trust in peers) in GVTs. In addition, we assess how these mechanisms are affected by the team context in the form of openness to cultural diversity. We do this by studying 23 GVTs (171 team members and 23 team leaders) in the global R&D department of a Danish engineering company. Our findings demonstrate that trust in peers is positively associated with job role clarity and job performance at the individual-level, and that high team openness to diversity, in the case of performance, makes the individual's level of trust in peers less necessary for achieving performance. Our results also show that time zone adjustment increases job role clarity for the individual team member, but only in GVTs with high openness to cultural diversity. Based on this, we contribute to the organizational discontinuity theory by demonstrating how continuity-creating mechanisms can interact with the team context to ultimately support the individual's potential for handling distance in GVTs.",art

The number of employees with disabilities in the workforce is increasing and accommodations are essential to the work of many of these individuals. Prior research has explored perceptions of accommodation requests as well as coworkers' and managers' reactions to accommodations; yet, we know little about how employees with disabilities experience their own accommodations. We draw from the disability literature as well as contemporary justice and social exchange theory to develop and subsequently test a multilevel moderated mediation model on this subject. We test our hypotheses with data from 4,083 employees nested in 256 workgroups across two time points. We find support for our prediction that accommodation-focused interpersonal justice influences turnover intentions. The effect of these justice perceptions was mediated by workgroup openness to communication. Further, we find that representation of accommodated employees with disabilities at the workgroup level plays an important role in these relationships. We look beyond the technical aspects of accommodation with this research to highlight the social experience of accommodation as a central driver of employee perceptions and work outcomes.",art

We conceptualise these factors to be those that pressure individuals to engage in OCB. Tenured faculty (n = 300) from Sri Lanka completed measures administered in their primary language. Results indicated greater work-overload is associated with lower OCBI but higher OCBO and that allocentrism moderates the overload-OCBI relationship.

MNEs' HRM practices need to be mindful of the institutional differences between the local context of host countries and that of their home countries. Balancing the localization of HRM practices with the desire for global standardization and integration is a dilemma for MNEs. We examine this tension utilizing a unique perspective, namely by analyzing the HRM challenges that MNEs face with regard to LGBT employees in Africa. We find that MNEs experience difficulty in reconciling their global corporate values and HR policies with local institutions and legislative requirements. Several contributions result. First, by bringing issues of duality to the fore both at the organizational and individual level. Second, we contribute towards the global configuration literature in international HRM as regards global standardization and national differentiation, by focusing on developing countries, where the scale of the cultural or institutional distance between home and host countries are likely to be larger, which allows us to examine the difficulties of the transfer of HR practices to these sites. Third, we embed our analysis of localization within institutional theory, and finally, we integrate these contributions into an analysis of HRM challenges of LGBT employees in hostile contexts and make recommendations.",art

The study of employee voice in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) across national contexts remains under-theorised and under-studied. This paper uses Kaufman's integrative model of employee voice, and an exploratory study of 30 interviews with employees in non-unionised SMEs in the United Kingdom, Thailand and Nigeria, to compare the employee experience with voice, and the impact of this experience on voice behaviour at work. Findings show that the interaction between the external institutional context and internal SME context (organisational configuration, governance structure and internal contingencies in the employment relationship) impacts employee voice agency, the perceived levels of voice and, ultimately, employee voice behaviour. The paper contributes to employee voice theory by offering an analysis of voice determinants on voice behaviour specific to non-unionised SMEs from an international comparative employee perspective, presents these in an initial framework and explains how employees experience voice in small workplaces.",art

The purpose of this study is to explore the influence of intellectual capital (IC) on firm performance, considering the mediating role of innovation speed and quality. We develop a research model based on the IC perspective and innovation literature. We test the model by using structural equation modeling to analyze data collected from 328 high-technology firms in China. The results show that the three components of IC, namely human capital, structural capital, and relational capital, are positively related to innovation speed and quality, which in turn facilitate the operational and financial performance of a firm. The impacts of human and structural capital on financial performance are fully mediated by innovation speed and quality, whereas the impact of relational capital on financial performance is partially mediated. Innovation speed and quality partially mediate the effect of IC on operational performance. As one of the first studies to investigate how IC may influence firm performance through the mediating effects of innovation speed and quality, this study not only contributes to HRM literature on IC and innovation, but also offers managers with insights on how to align their HRM strategies and practices to develop IC when pursuing innovation and performance outcomes.",art

Drawing on the stressor-strain framework and conservation of resources theory, we hypothesized that subordinates' job satisfaction has a negative mediating effect between abusive supervision and subordinates' physical health and mental health problems. Because stressor-strain linkages are subject to individual-level variations, we further hypothesized that subordinates' power distance orientation moderates the relation between abusive supervision and job satisfaction, such that this relation is attenuated as power distance orientation increases. We tested these hypotheses on data collected from 603 employees through three surveys over a 12-month period in Japan. The findings support our hypotheses and moderated mediation model.",art

Given the strongly held consensus that empowering leadership is beneficial, leadership scholars have overstated its benefits and overlooked its costs. In response to increasing calls for investigation of empowering leadership's double-edged effects, we uncover the enabling and burdening effects of empowering leadership on employees' work-life interface by positioning job demands and work passion as important underlying mechanisms. Based on the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory, we contend that via serial mediating roles of learning demands and harmonious passion, empowering leadership may positively relate to employee work enhancement of personal life. Empowering leadership can also predict employee work interference with personal life via serial mediating roles of outcome responsibility and obsessive passion. Four-wave data based on the Indian managerial employees (n = 251) supported our serial mediation hypotheses.

Hinged on the Resource Orchestration Theory (ROT), this study investigates the influence of human resource strategic roles and operational roles on green human resource management (green HRM) through the mediation of perceived environmental orientation. A self-administered questionnaire technique was used, and data were collected from 139 HR professionals from the hospitality industry in Pakistan. The finding from using Smart PLS-SEM 3 shows that the strategic role significantly influences the green HRM; however, the operational role does not influence green HRM. Also, the relationships between strategic role and operational role with environmental orientation were significant. Furthermore, a significant relationship exists between environmental orientation and green HRM. In addition, perceived environmental orientation significantly mediates the relationships between strategic role and operational role with green HRM.

Although recent studies examined the factors influencing older workers' early retirement decisions, little is known about how age-related shifts in social roles from the work to family domains affect older workers' early retirement intentions. Guided by role theory, we propose that flexible human resource (HR) practices are negatively related to older workers' early retirement intentions via decreased role conflict (work-family and family-work conflict). Furthermore, we take a role identity perspective and argue that gender may work as a fundamental contingency factor influencing the relationship between role conflict (work-family and family-work conflict) and early retirement intentions. Data were collected from Chinese organizations with a matching sample of 228 older workers (aged 45 years and older) and HR managers from 48 organizations, and a multilevel path analysis was conducted to test the hypotheses. The results showed that flexible HR practices have a negative indirect relationship with early retirement intentions through decreased family-to-work conflict. The influence of family-to-work conflict on early retirement intentions is stronger for women than for men. We also found that the effect of work-to-family conflict on early retirement intentions is stronger than that of family-to-work conflict.

This paper focuses on perceptions of Developmental HRM Practices (DHRMP) and their relationship with employee outcomes. We extend the currently existing and predominant social exchange perspective with insights from uncertainty (reduction) theory, to examine vertical (between employee and supervisor) and horizontal (between employee and co-workers reporting to the same supervisor) (in)congruences in DHRMP perceptions, and their relationships with employees' affective organizational commitment (AOC), turnover intention and proactive behavior. Data from 369 employees in 46 teams, and multi-level polynomial regressions show that for vertical (in)congruence, AOC and turnover intention are most favorable when both the employee's and supervisor's perceptions are congruent and positive. This nuances previous research rooted in social exchange theory as it implies that positive employee perceptions of DHRMP, in isolation, are insufficient to maximize both outcomes. In contrast, we find the highest proactive behavior for employees perceiving positive DHRMP, irrespective of their supervisor's perceptions. Finally, for horizontal (in)congruence, AOC and proactive behavior are highest when the employee's perceptions are more positive than their co-workers', and suboptimal when both parties have similarly positive perceptions. This suggests that incongruence in DHRMP perceptions is not necessarily counterproductive.",art

This article examines the ways transitioning employees perceive employing organizations' readiness and willingness to deal with gender transitions and identifies barriers to those employees being able to express their gender in the workplace in their preferred manner. We draw on interviews with 25 transitioning trans persons who, over a period of two years, were interviewed on four occasions and asked about the ways in which their gender transition was handled at work. It appears that societal cisnormative and binarist gender regimes are pervasive in HR practices, restricting the support for, and acceptance of, trans and non-binary employees' gender transitions in the workplace in several ways. Besides confirming the perceived lack of organizational knowledge about transgender issues in general, and gender transitions more specifically, the interviews reveal that in order to become intelligible for HR managers and colleagues, employee transgender status has to be both visible, and unambiguously attributable to either a male or female gender expression. Everything in-between, gender-non-conforming, non-binary, non-gendered, or mutable seems to be met with confusion and receives less acceptance and support. Furthermore, the results show the temporal and declining nature of support and understanding during a gender transition. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.",art

Drawing on the socially embedded model of thriving, we propose a model that includes the mediating role of thriving at work and the moderating role played by wasta in the relationship between HPWS and the employee outcomes of affective commitment, job satisfaction, and career satisfaction. To test the conceptual model, we collected data from 187 healthcare workers across Saudi Arabian hospitals at three time points. Our findings reveal that HPWSs positively affect employees' thriving at work, which in turn enhances their work and career outcomes. Our study also demonstrates that wasta is a boundary condition that buffers the strength of the effect of HPWSs on thriving and the indirect effects of HPWSs on employees' work and career outcomes via thriving. This study extends current theoretical knowledge of how and when HPWSs can exert a more positive influence on employee outcomes. In practice, these findings will inform managers of better approaches to leveraging HPWSs and individual cultural values to enhance employee outcomes.",art

We report a phenomenographic study that reveals philosophies elicited on talent management (TM) systems in a sample of Australian subsidiaries of foreign multinational enterprises. We label these philosophies as The Carrot, The Risk, The Caretaker, The Conversation and The Strength. Each philosophy portends a unique TM system, guided by an overarching tenet alongside operational principles across function, timeframe and stakeholder foci. We speculate that a set of internal and external contingencies, based on country- and firm-level contexts, influence philosophies on TM systems. Reporting these nuances and distinctions across philosophies, we contribute to a possible shift in the TM literature from non-contextualized, generalized TM models to explicit firm and country contextualized representations that convey the unique value and treatment of a firm's talent, as it is understood by practicing managers.",art

Managing the work-family interface is increasingly strategic for international human resource management (HRM) in attracting and retaining a diverse workforce. Yet despite growing methodological sophistication in the field work-family research still lacks a truly global approach, one that considers alternative work and family conceptualisations, particularly those from the so-called Global South. This article addresses these shortcomings by proposing mixed methods research (MMR), rather than a single method (quantitative or quantitative only), to offer a dual analytical lens which can deepen and broaden our understanding of work-family issues in and across diverse and multinational contexts. We critically review the methodological features of 40 work-family studies that used MMR, revealing the need for stronger integration. Then, through a thematic analysis of the reviewed articles, we highlight three distinct ways in which MMR adds value to the field: grounding empirical work and theorising within context, improving appropriateness of measurement instruments, and enhancing validity of inferences for relevant HRM practices. We conclude with an agenda for future mixed methods work-family research and present implications for human resource managers and work-family scholars in an increasingly competitive and changing international employment milieu.

This study examines how an organization's socialization tactics and supervisor behaviors can influence a newcomer's psychological contract by identifying the specific factors involved in its formation process. It hypothesizes that socialization tactics and supervisor behaviors would help newcomers perceive more promises in their relationship with the organization and that this relationship would be mediated by the acquisition of organizational information. In this study, a longitudinal approach was adopted and 221 newcomers at major Korean companies were surveyed twice, with a three-month interval between the surveys. The results show that the extent to which socialization tactics are institutionalized positively affects newcomers' perception of promises. The extent to which supervisors demonstrate relational behaviors also positively affects newcomers' perceptions of promises. Further, these relationships are fully mediated by the acquisition of organizational information. The results show the significant impact of socialization tactics and supervisor behaviors on the formation of psychological contracts, highlighting the role of information as one of the causal explanations of these relationships.",art

Given the challenges of new ventures to attract applicants, this paper focuses on the influence of applicants' perceptions of entrepreneurs for new venture recruitment. Based on role congruity theory, we propose that organizational attractiveness increases when entrepreneurs show entrepreneurial leadership, which fits the new venture context, and that this effect is mediated by perceived authenticity. Moreover, we propose this effect is particularly pertinent when entrepreneurs are young and male and thus fit the prevailing demographic stereotype of entrepreneurs. In our experiment (n = 503), we found the positive effect of showing entrepreneurial leadership on organizational attractiveness via authenticity perceptions, and this effect was stronger if the entrepreneur was young - the entrepreneur's gender did not moderate the relationship. We discuss the implications of our study for research and practice in recruitment and entrepreneurship.",art

Survey results from 297 Chinese companies suggest that companies' perceived complexity toward AI constrains AI adoption, while technology competence and regulatory support encourage AI adoption. Relative advantages of AI technology, company size, and industry have no significant impact on AI usage.

With many organisations operating in challenging circumstances such as military conflicts and pandemics, a growing body of research has investigated the effects of extreme-context perceptions on job attitudes and organisational outcomes. While prior investigations focused on specific extreme contexts like warzones or pandemics, research has yet to examine whether different extreme contexts would have different intensities regarding shaping job attitudes and organisational outcomes. This study takes a unique approach to address this gap in the existing literature by exploring whether the type of extreme context (war vs pandemic) moderates extreme-context-perception effects on work alienation and subsequent job attitudes and organisational outcomes. Specifically, this study investigates the consequences of differentiated extreme contexts by using 668 valid responses from two samples: Sample 1 (N = 449), collected via snowball sampling during the Syrian civil war (2016-2019), and Sample 2 (N = 219), recruited using systematic random sampling from the Middle East during COVID-19 in 2021. Employing t-tests, Sample 1 in the wartime crisis reported higher levels of extreme-context perception, yet not quite as much worsened job satisfaction, but they had lower levels of alienation and job insecurity than those in health-crisis contexts. Using PLS-SEM, we found extreme-context perception heightened alienation, leading to increased job insecurity, decreased job satisfaction, and lower organisational citizenship behaviour (OCB) outcomes. Interestingly, some of these relationships were moderated by the extreme context type. Specifically, while no significant differences were found between the two contexts regarding the relationship between extreme context perception and alienation and between alienation and job insecurity, we found that extreme-context-driven alienation is more likely to damage job satisfaction and OCB in war zones than in pandemic contexts. These findings contribute to important matters of both theory and practice. They specifically expand existing theory by illustrating differentiated consequences of distinct types of extreme contexts to organisational and employee-related concerns. They also demonstrate the need to develop customised organisational strategies as well as policy responses to mitigate and/or capitalise on the effects of differentiated extreme contexts.",art

In the current study, we contend that one way in which the management of people and work impacts organization performance is through building capabilities. More specifically, expanding beyond the traditional HR systems-organization performance research literature, we examine how HR flexibility, technical HRM, strategically-oriented HRM, and workforce strategic importance build a specific type of capabilities, namely organization strategic human capabilities, which in turn drives organization performance. Within a global, cross-industry sample composed of 9,923 individuals from 505 for-profit organizations, HR flexibility, strategically-oriented HRM, and workforce strategic importance were found to have positive effects on organization strategic human capabilities. Our findings also indicate that both technical and strategically-oriented HRM affect organization strategic human capabilities indirectly through HR flexibility. Furthermore, in addition to its positive effect on organization strategic human capabilities, workforce strategic importance was found to moderate HR flexibility's positive effect on organization strategic human capabilities. Finally, within a subsample composed of 8,060 individuals from 284 for-profit organizations, organization strategic human capabilities were found to be a key proximal precursor of organization performance.",art
10.1080/09585192.2024.2377221,"How does the supervisor-subordinate relational schema shape employee voice behaviour in China?. Previous research has shown that the relationship between a supervisor and a subordinate is crucial in shaping employee voice behaviour. However, where these relationships originate needs to be clarified. Studies on relational schemas suggest that the quality of these relationships depends on the relational schemas held by both leaders and subordinates. Unfortunately, these two research areas have developed independently and have yet to intersect, which limits our understanding of how social interactions between leaders and subordinates impact employee voice behaviour. Based on research from both domains, the current study examines how the supervisor-subordinate relational schema affects employees' voice behaviour. Our proposal, grounded in complexity theory, suggests that the expectations of both leaders and subordinates about their relationship model determine whether employees choose to voice their opinions to their leaders. Analyses of data from a survey of 416 matched pairs of leaders and subordinates in China conducted using fsQCA and LPA largely support our view. The results indicate that the configuration of the supervisor-subordinate relational schema among leaders and subordinates can predict the level of employee voice behaviour. Additionally, this configuration is a natural subset of the population. These findings have important implications for improving employee voice behaviour in organizations.",art

We examine nonbinary employees' experiences with misgendering in work contexts and draw from minority stress theory (Meyer, 2003) to understand the consequences of misgendering. Our findings from 29 semi-structured interviews with nonbinary individuals revealed that although being misgendered is a common and highly stressful experience (distal stressor), the emotional labor associated with anticipating and reacting to misgendering acts as an additional and more proximal stressor. Together, these stressors jointly contribute to all three components of employee burnout (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced professional efficacy). We also identified support from coworkers and supervisors (in preventing and addressing misgendering) as important ameliorating factors. As such, our findings provide support for the tenets of minority stress theory and extend this work by focusing specifically on nonbinary employees and on burnout, an important outcome for both employees and organizations. These findings provide a more complete understanding of the lived experiences of nonbinary employees and make unique contributions to the diversity/inclusion, gender studies, queer studies, work/life, and occupational health literatures.",art

Although numerous empirical studies have linked human resource (HR) management systems, including systematic HR practices, such as high-performance work systems (HPWS), to superior organizational performance, our understanding of how these benefits vary among firms operating under different levels of environmental uncertainty is limited. By integrating insights from organizational theory, strategy, and strategic human resource management (SHRM), I theorize that an organization's internal and external environments-specifically firm age and industry dynamism-modulate the benefits derived from HPWS. Utilizing longitudinal data encompassing 1,585 firm-year observations across five waves from 2009 to 2017, I demonstrate that the positive impact of HPWS on organizational performance is most pronounced for younger firms in highly dynamic industries. Conversely, for older firms, this positive effect weakens as industry dynamism increases. Additionally, I discovered that cooperative norms serve as a crucial mediating mechanism. My findings mark a significant advance in our understanding of when and how firms, amidst varying degrees of environmental uncertainty, reap differential benefits from HPWS-especially through the mediation of cooperative norms.",art

It is well-established in the human resource management literature that high intensity and excessive workload can cause undesirable physiological, psychological, behavioural, and social outcomes. However, there is a need to theorise the process by which extreme work has been legitimised and embedded among professionals. In this paper, we view extreme workers as those professionals who contribute to their works beyond acceptable contractual obligations, either voluntarily for personal rewards or involuntarily due to the menace of penalty, or both. We chose to investigate how accounting professionals in India legitimise extreme work in their workplaces using exploratory qualitative research methods and applied economies of worth theoretical framework. Our findings demonstrate that senior accounting professionals with the assistance of professional associations can play an important role in mobilising professional and organisational resources to tackle extreme work in their accounting firms and the industry.",art

Patterns of devolution of human resource management responsibilities to line managers vary significantly, giving rise to the important question of what accounts for such variability in the assignment of these responsibilities. Building on theoretical insights from both contextual strategic human resource management and structural contingency theory, we conceptualise the combined role of both proximal and distal factors in the form of institutional, competitive, and heritage-based mechanisms in accounting for variations in devolution. Then, employing data from 5918 organisations across 35 countries, we test our ideas using multi-level modelling. We find that competitive and heritage mechanisms, as more proximal influences, offer explanatory power, while the more distal institutional factors included in our analysis do not reach significance. Our work underscores the importance of theorizing the role of multiple, co-occurring proximal and distal multi-level influences when seeking to unearth commonalities and differences in the uptake of devolution in different contexts. This study also complements the predominant managerialist view on the assignment of human resource management responsibilities to line managers commonplace in the literature.",art

We present evidence of a three-way interaction. We surveyed 173 senior Indian managers working in public and private sectors to measure their perceptions of empowerment, authentic leadership, and organizational politics. Employing ordinary least-square regression, we tested for simple and complex interactions.

To address this theoretical blind spot, drawing from the general risk-taking perspective, we investigated how and when performance goal orientations shape employee UPB. We first conducted a business simulation study (Study 1) with 86 undergraduate students and found that performance-approach goal orientation had a positive effect on UPB engagement. Next, we sampled 446 employees from 93 teams (Study 2). Results showed that the relationship between performance-approach goal orientation and UPB was mediated by risk taking. Furthermore, performance-avoidance goal orientation was negatively related to risk taking and subsequent UPB for individuals perceive lower levels of UPB injunctive norm induced by higher ethical leadership. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications, and offer several directions for future research.",art

This article investigates how meso-level actors (MeLAs) contribute to HR practice transfer in diffusion and adaptation processes, drawing on the System-Society-Dominance-Corporate Effects (SSDC) framework to interpret the role of MeLAs in the transfer of the Japanese management model to the Indonesian automotive industry. We focus on two issues: i) the way Japanese MeLAs' training regimes in Japan affect the diffusion of the model and ii) the coordinated Japanese and Indonesian MeLAs strategy in seeking procedural influence through knowledge-sharing and in facilitating transfer activities over how the Japanese model is adapted in Indonesia. Our research adds to our limited understanding of the significance of MeLAs in processes of diffusion-adaptation in emerging market economies characterized by weak regulatory regimes and asymmetric socioeconomic power relations. Drawing on interviews with 75 key informants across Japan and Indonesia, we explore the significance of MeLAs from corporate and labor spheres alongside those of non-corporate MeLAs. Theoretically, this study extends the SSDC framework by highlighting MeLAs' influence in both diffusing conceptions of dominant management 'best practice' (dominance effects) and their role - and that of dominance effects - in shaping societal effects that inform how the model is adapted. We theorize the complex processes through which the effects identified in the SSDC framework are experienced by local actors, showing that they are neither monolithic nor mechanical in nature and thereby elaborating the inter-relationship in how dominance effects inform societal effects.",art

Drawing on conservation of resources theory, we use time-lagged data from 243 employees in five firms in China to investigate the processes underlying the links between negative workplace gossip and SWB. Our findings show that negative workplace gossip has a significant negative effect on SWB, and that psychological distress mediates this relationship. We also find that emotional intelligence plays a moderating role between negative workplace gossip and targets' psychological distress. Our results indicate for the first time that negative workplace gossip increases psychological distress and lowers SWB among its targets. As a result, several managerial implications are suggested, such as seeking to reduce the prevalence of negative workplace gossip, offering early support to employees in psychological distress, and taking steps to raise the emotional intelligence level of staff.",art

Entrepreneurs are critical human resources that have a significant impact on the performance of entrepreneurial firms. Yet, the nature of many entrepreneurial resources means that they are in demand by both their work (firms) and their families. Little is known about the impact that such dual demands might have on an entrepreneur's ability to manage their own resources for their firm's performance. Drawing upon conservation of resources (COR) theory and family-work literature, this paper develops a model to examine how family-to-work conflict (FWC) and family-to-work enrichment (FWE) shape the performance of entrepreneurial firms, directly and indirectly, through the mediation of entrepreneurial commitments. The model also explores the potential role of entrepreneurs' key personal resources as a unique type of human resource that utilizes entrepreneurs' internal dispositions to moderate the relationship between FWC/FWE and entrepreneurial commitments (and, hence, business performance). Empirical results from a study of 261 entrepreneurial firms in China provide support for our conceptual model. The paper has important implications for both HRM and entrepreneurship research and practices.",art

A personal characteristics-CSR capacity-organizational reinforcing model of employees' motivation for voluntary CSR activities. Employees' participation in corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a channel that not only helps corporations convey their social responsibility messages but also, in the long run, enhances stakeholder-organization relationships and builds corporate image. Given the important role employees play in CSR, inadequate attention is paid to their motivation to engage in voluntary CSR activities, and there is a research gap in the literature in terms of a lack of a systematic view of that motivation. Therefore, this study seeks to narrow this gap by exploring the factors influencing individual employees' motivation to take part in voluntary CSR activities, using a qualitative approach, with empirical data collected from employees of leading CSR companies in Vietnam. Through grounded theory analysis, our findings lead to the proposal of a personal characteristics - CSR capacity - organizational reinforcing model, revealing different intrinsic and extrinsic elements, categorized into personal characteristics, CSR capacities and organizational reinforcement, that motivate employees to participate and engage in voluntary CSR activities.

Firm-specific human capital (HC) is widely recognised as the most important resource for superior firm performance. Contemporary literature on the resource-based view (RBV) and resource orchestration has stressed the importance of organising resources, such as firm-specific HC, in order to fully exploit them. However, companies with idiosyncratic resources cannot rely on established resource exploitation practices, making the exploitation of firm-specific HC a complex issue. Nevertheless, few studies have empirically examined how to orchestrate firm-specific HC. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine how resource orchestration-operationalised as collaborative human resource management (CHRM) and entrepreneurial orientation (EO) both individually and combined-moderates the relationship between firm-specific HC and firm performance. Based on a sample of 151 Swedish manufacturing firms, the findings demonstrate that CHRM and EO do not independently influence the relationship between firm-specific HC and performance. However, firms with firm-specific HC benefit from either being highly entrepreneurial and relying on CHRM or being non-entrepreneurial and not focusing on CHRM; they perform worst if they are entrepreneurial without using CHRM. Whereas previous RBV-studies on resource exploitation have mainly stressed that HC has to be exploited, this study contributes to the RBV by examining how firm-specific HC should be exploited.",art

Building mainly upon the resource-based theory, social exchange theory, and relational theory, this paper integrates three research streams that propose how human capital, affective commitment, and inter-team relational coordination relate to each other in the mediation between high-performance work systems (HPWSs) and team performance. Questionnaires were distributed to employees and supervisors in 189 teams from different companies in Chile to test a sequential mediation model of the HPWS-team performance relationship, using the mediation paths of human capital and affective commitment as antecedents of inter-team relational coordination. Structural Equation Modeling is used to assess whether data support the hypothesized pathways. Results support a mediated sequential path in which HPWSs influence human capital and affective commitment, which in turn affect inter-team relational coordination, while the three mediators influence team performance. Furthermore, post-hoc analyses suggest that the Opportunities component of the Ability-Motivation-Opportunity (AMO) model of human resource practices has a stronger and direct impact on the inter-team relational coordination mediation path than the abilities and motivation components of the AMO model. This study contributes to the understanding of how human capital, affective commitment and inter-team relational coordination relate to each other within the mediation of HPWSs-team performance relationship.",art

Given ever increasing work and nonwork demands, achieving work-nonwork (WNW) balance is an important priority for many employees. Scholars have only recently settled on a definition of WNW balance as multidimensional and, as such, our understanding of its antecedents and outcomes is limited. Drawing on Conservation of Resources theory, we explore how organizations can support employees to achieve WNW balance and whether 'balanced' employees are more productive at work and satisfied with life. In detail, we hypothesize that the positive effect of supervisor WNW support (FSS) on employees' life satisfaction and job performance is mediated by multidimensional WNW balance. We find, across two studies with two waves each, that only the dimension of WNW balance effectiveness and not the dimension of WNW balance satisfaction mediated the relationships between FSS, life satisfaction (Study 1 and 2) and self-rated job performance (Study 1). The relationship between FSS and supervisor-rated job performance (Study 2) was not mediated by either WNW balance dimension. As such, organizations can facilitate WNW balance through FSS, while 'balanced' employees seem indeed happier with their life and consider themselves to be better performing at work. We discuss the unexpected finding regarding the superior role of WNW balance effectiveness over WNW balance satisfaction for our outcomes in relation to the conceptualization of WNW balance as multidimensional and delineate important theoretical and practical implications.",art

The continuing nature of those relationships may result in employees using previously unknown strategies to regulate emotions. To develop an understanding of intrinsic and extrinsic emotion regulation (ER) strategies in service relationships, we interviewed 42 aged care employees in China. Using template analysis we found three new employee-client relationship-based intrinsic ER strategies (i.e. family appreciation, filial reappraisal and deliberate distancing), a self-based strategy (i.e. self-deterioration anticipation) and three client-based strategies (i.e. client deterioration anticipation, vulnerability justification and meaning identification) in managing one's own emotions in service relationships. When managing others' emotions in ongoing service settings, a new relationship-based extrinsic ER strategy (i.e. communal bonding) along with situation-based and client-based extrinsic ER strategies were identified. Employees can regulate their own and others' emotions by crafting their relationships with clients. This study suggests that service relationship is a critical dimension of client interactions and should be considered in workplace ER research.",art

This special issue aims to advance our understanding of talent management in emerging market economies. The uniqueness of this special issue was that it invited and accepted contributions on talent management in emerging countries at multiple levels. At the macro level, i.e. from a country level perspective, given the prevalence of state intervention in emerging economies, we were interested in understanding the impact of state ownership/intervention on talent management in those markets. From a meso level, i.e. from a firm level perspective, we were interested in empirical evidence, as to how talent management contributes to performance in emerging markets. Finally, at a micro level, i.e. from an individual level, we were interested in empirical work on research topics such as the career expectations of talent in emerging markets, and the factors that determine the attractiveness of employers for employees in emerging markets. The papers that represented contextual data from lesser-represented emerging countries, were included in this special issue. More specifically, these papers contextually represented the emerging countries namely Nepal, Russia, The United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, Poland, Iraq and the last study included a collection of data from 19 African countries. We contribute through this editorial piece by comparing the seven papers included in this special issue to both, previous work in the last two decades or so (2000-2022), globally and within International Journal of Human Resource Management, and identify meaningful future research directions.",art

Employee engagement is critical for the sustenance of organizations. Scholars have highlighted that the employer-employee interaction is an essential mechanism that enhances employee engagement. The communicative and interactional features of AI applications in HRM allow for a personalized and individualized approach to employees. The proliferation of AI-based solutions is increasing in various dimensions of HR business processes, leading to enhanced employee experiences and job satisfaction. However, this research domain is exploratory concerning the impact of AI-mediation HRM practices. Based on a multi-source, time-lagged study spanning over ten months in a multinational company, we have investigated the impact of AI-enabled chatbots on employee engagement in the present study. We have also examined climate for trust as the path through which chatbots impact engagement. Moreover, we have analyzed the implications of AI-enabled chatbots on employee outcomes based on their age and past performance.

In this paper, we explore how institutional actors push or resist equality, diversity and inclusion in light of power relations in their respective country contexts. We conducted interviews with a range of institutional actors, including governmental organizations, employer representatives, unions, professional associations, and civil society organizations working on EDI issues in Germany and Turkey, two countries with very different socioeconomic and political settings. Our findings suggest that EDI fields are structured by country-specific power relations: they appear as competitively dispersed in Germany and politically polarized in Turkey, depending on the social position of the actors and the type of field fragmentation. These field characteristics, in turn, nurture different patterns of actors' strategies such as framing and mobilizing aimed at maintaining or disrupting the institutionalized status quo of EDI. We propose that a critical, power-sensitive institutional work approach to EDI is a useful lens through which to examine extra-organizational country contexts in international HRM research and, in particular, context-sensitive studies of EDI. As a practical implication, EDI and HR managers will be sensitized to the relevance of building coalitions with external stakeholders if they are to advance EDI within their organizations.",art

In European countries, the COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to a demanding work situation for office employees who have been required to work from home (hereinafter referred to as remote workers). Due to curfews, school closures, and leisure restrictions in Austria, remote work circumstances have changed compared to before the pandemic. By combining event system theory with transactional stress theory, we aim to identify the most important resources for maintaining remote workers' well-being, perceived productivity, and engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected daily data (five working days for each remote worker) once from March to May 2020 (2222 employees) and again from November 2020 to January 2021 (1268 employees) and explored the role of personal (self-goal setting, self-efficacy, home-office experience), external (equipment at home), and organizational (work-related and social) resources for changes in well-being, perceived productivity, and engagement. Well-being and engagement decreased less when remote workers indicated high resources of self-efficacy and social support at the beginning of the crises. Results further reveal that an improvement in resources from the first to the second measurement was associated with a reduced decline in well-being, productivity, and engagement, respectively. We discuss implications for HRM and provide suggestions for future research.",art

This study examines the status quo of workplace gender (in)equality research in the Chinese context. By reviewing 173 articles from 96 English journals throughout 1988-2020, it reveals that various forms of discrimination still exist against women in the labour market and workplaces. In particular, the persisting, and arguably widening, gender pay gap reflects not only the sticky floor, but also the glass ceiling, effects. The review also shows that researchers have tended to favour quantitative more than qualitative methods. While a range of theoretical perspectives has been mobilized to explain manifestations of gender inequality, a critical feminist approach has been rare for political, institutional, cultural, and research capability reasons. Moreover, there is limited interest in the notion of (gender) diversity management, suggesting that diversity management has not yet become part of the strategic HRM research in the Chinese context. Similarly, extant HRM and organizational behaviour research rarely treats gender (in)equality as a key construct to illuminate the potential effect of such a (perceived) form of organizational injustice on the well-being of female and minority male employees. Based on our review analysis, we identify several opportunities for future research to advance workplace gender scholarship and practice.",art

In this overview, we introduce a special issue featuring six articles on various aspects related to the role of Human Resource Management in managing mental illness at work. This introduction article starts with an overview of what we know and do not know about mental illness in the context of work and why more insights related to mental illness at work are much needed. The special issue features a unique set of articles that employ different methodologies and approaches to studying mental illness at work. Theoretical perspectives presented include tension-centred theory, ethical HRM, diversity theory, person-job fit, and critical disability studies. The articles outline and discuss HRM policies, practices and strategies used to manage individuals with mental illness, the experiences of individuals with mental illness in the context of work, and includes a review on disclosure of mental illness in the workplace. Recommendations for continued research are presented and a range of theoretical lenses and perspectives are discussed as possible foundations for future inquiry focusing on context, sampling, and methods, as well as further empirical investigations of the full range of stakeholders' perspectives (i.e. individuals with mental illness; co-workers and peers; and organizational-level factors such as policies, and leaders and HR managers' perspectives).

However, there are significant research gaps: 1) the development of social media has been crucial to the growth of social networks, yet we know little about its influence on network recruitment; 2) studies on network recruitment generally focus on employees' rather than employers' perspectives; 3) the context of most research is the US labour market, which then identifies a need for contributions relating to other countries. The aim of this study is to analyse and discuss recruiters' use of SNS to evaluate the networks of potential candidates. To understand how and why recruiters assess online networks, we used qualitative data from a Swedish study. Our analysis showed that recruiters search the internet either to find information that helps them ascertain the candidate as trustworthy, or to evaluate the candidate's social capital through the size and composition of their networks. For certain job positions especially, active management of one's online networks thus becomes crucial. Finally, this study illustrates how network connections may undermine rather than build trust, and thereby challenges a belief in the positive impact of networks.",art

Based on interviews with sheltered workshop professionals and observations in these organizations, this qualitative study identifies and describes human resource management (HRM) practices related to individuals with MHCs and how these practices come into being. Three types of practices were identified: identity-blind practices, which are common to all employees regardless of their disability types; identity-conscious practices, which are specifically adapted to individuals with MHCs; and individual-conscious practices, which go beyond a mental health diagnosis and are specifically adapted to the individual at a particular moment in time. Several drivers lead to these practices: organizational or individual awareness of the need for adaptation, the intention to adapt, the availability of organizational resources, and the organizations' allowance for flexibility. By analyzing the specific needs of individuals with MHCs in the sheltered sector, the article extends the concepts of identity-blind and identity-conscious practices and outlines several types of HRM diversity practices.",art

This study investigates how the Psychological Capital (PsyCap) of small and medium enterprises (SME) leaders has influenced their strategic responses, ultimately impacting the performance of their companies, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Embedded within research on behavioral micro-foundations in strategy, and based on the resource-based theory (RBT) of the individual entrepreneur as well as positive organizational behavior literature, we hypothesize that SME leaders' psychological resources can act as a strategic advantage during crises by making them adopt cost-cutting and investment measures for their companies performance. By using a sample of 372 SMEs, we find that while leaders mostly use both measures, leaders with a high PsyCap prefer adopting investment measures, which positively influences the performance of their companies during a crisis. However, adopting cost-cutting measures lowers performance. We contribute to the entrepreneurship literature by using PsyCap in the context of the RBT of the individual entrepreneur and shedding light on which measures sustain or increase SMEs' performance during a crisis.

Downsizing is a legitimate yet highly disruptive human resource management practice that organisations can activate when costs need to be cut. We adopt an institutionalist lens to explore how both legislative and economic forces combine to shape organisations' adoption of employee downsizing practices. We conduct multilevel mixed-effects ordered probit regression analyses on our survey data on human resource management practices from 29 countries and four rounds of data collection spanning seventeen years. The findings indicate that variations in downsizing practices can be partly explained by differences in national legal institutions as well as by prevailing economic conditions. Importantly, we also find that constraints imposed by national regulatory institutions may be relaxed during periods of economic crisis. We theorise the interaction of coercive, mimetic and normative isomorphic effects to understand how organisational operating contexts are dynamic, whereby both constraints and opportunities can vary over time.",art

Over the past two decades, sustainable human resource management (sustainable HRM) has emerged as a new approach to human resource management. Sustainable HRM takes a stakeholder-inclusive perspective to ensure the sustainable development of organizations along multiple objectives (financial, social, environmental, and organizational). Human resource (HR) managers are key actors in sustainable HRM implementation. However, how these important stakeholders perceive sustainable HRM remains understudied in the growing literature. This qualitative study explores how 32 HR managers in Italy construct the meaning of sustainable HRM and perceive their roles in and the barriers to implementing a sustainable HRM strategy. The findings reveal that Italian HR managers interpret sustainable HRM in line with the triple bottom line sustainability framework but give particular prominence to the social dimension. We develop a framework of HR managers' roles in the sustainable HRM paradigm comprising sustainability strategy owners, social innovators, corporate social responsibility (CSR) partnership architects, genuine employee champions, and administrative experts. Additionally, we develop a model of the barriers to sustainable HRM adoption. This study advances the sustainable HRM literature by providing a contextualized, country-specific understanding of sustainable HRM and frameworks for the roles of HR managers under a sustainable HRM paradigm and the barriers to its adoption.",art

Pakistan's manufacturing industry is under a lot of pressure to deal with environmental issues such as carbon monoxide emissions, poisonous compounds, and manufacturing waste. Green HR practices are considered to be fundamental pillars and are considered to be crucial in the development and optimization of environmentally sustainable initiatives. Hence, the objective of this research is to analyze the effects of green HR practices implemented in the manufacturing sector of Pakistan on employees' proactivity with regard to environmental issues. The data was acquired through the distribution of a survey questionnaire to manufacturing firms. The data was analyzed using SMART-PLS. The findings demonstrated that green HR practices have a substantial effect on the proactive behavior of employees. Additionally, the results indicated that organizational identification acts as a complementary mediator between green HR practices and the proactive behavior of employees in reducing environmental effects. Furthermore, it was discovered that proactive personality acted as a catalyst to enhance the impact of GHRM on the proactive behavior of employees with regard to environmental initiatives. Future research directions and managerial implications were also discussed.The study offers a conceptual framework linking GHRM and employees' proactive behavior for environmental impact in the manufacturing sector of Pakistan.Based on the theory of planned behavior, the study extends GHRM research by including a mediator called 'organizational identification'.With the support of trait activation theory, proactive personality is used as a moderator to strengthen the relationship between GHRM and employees' proactive environmental behavior.Results indicate a positive and statistically significant association between green HR practices and employees' proactive environmental behavior.",art

Danish retail banking is characterized by a role conflict between sales and advice. Through the lens of identity work, this study explores how bankers negotiate this conflict by seeking to make sense of themselves and justify the work that they do. We show that bankers are keenly aware of the role conflicts they face in doing their jobs, but they also discover ways of making these conflicts meaningfully productive for themselves, their employers, and their customers. To explain these findings, we introduce Hartmut Rosa's concept of resonance, provisionally understood as a processual and relational conceptualization of well-being. This leads to a conceptualization of bankers' identity work of managing the sales-advice tension as striving for professional resonance, the attainment of which is possible through three strategies: an advice orientation, which can be understood as a protection of resonance; a sale orientation, which relies on a promise of resonance; and an integration of sales and advice, which can be seen as an incorporation of resonance. Following the analysis, the normativity of resonance theory is leveraged in a critical discussion of the identified strategies of professional resonance, and the potential implications for well-being research and human resource management practices are considered.",art

Leveraging intersectionality as a lens, we explore the life-history accounts of former military migrants (MMs) on their transition out of the military service into civilian work. Data for the inquiry comes from in-depth interviews with MMs from West African Commonwealth countries who joined the UK military between 1998 and 2010. Focusing on the intersectionality of contexts, situatedness, positionalities, and identities of MMs, we theorise how this group of veterans account for their '(un)gilded' transition from military service to joining civilian work. Played out as a process of 'way-finding', MMs' transition out of military service into civilian work, we found, is characterised by four salient tropes: sculpturing an angel in a block of marble; randomness, luck, and chance; figurational support networks; and the show of 'grace under pressure'. Providing situated insights into the transitioning experiences of MMs, our study delineates how this group of veterans rationalise their career choices and adds nuance to how they draw on their intersecting migrant and veteran identities to respond to and overcome everyday structural barriers. We conclude with a discussion of our findings and their implications for the theory and practice of human resource management and the employment of veterans in civilian work.",art

We also posit that organizational structure not only moderates the relationship between CEOs' inclusive leadership and department managers' inclusive leadership, but also plays a role in the relationship between department managers' inclusive leadership and department-level inclusive climate. By analyzing paired data of 106 CEOs, 204 department managers, and 975 employees, we found that department managers' inclusive leadership mediated the relationship between CEOs' inclusive leadership and employees' well-being, but the serial mediation role of department managers' inclusive leadership and department-level inclusive climate in the effect of CEOs' inclusive leadership on employees' well-being was not supported. Organizational structure moderated the relationship between CEOs' inclusive leadership and department managers' inclusive leadership. Specifically, when organizations have organic structures rather than mechanistic structures, the relationship between CEOs' inclusive leadership and department managers' inclusive leadership is stronger. However, the moderating role of organizational structure in the relationship between department managers' inclusive leadership and inclusive department climate was not supported.",art

This paper empirically examines the impact of organisational psychological support on employees' outcomes as an example of the 'Common Good HRM' model on the well-being - performance continuum of police officers, using a Conservation of Resources (COR) theoretical framework. The study uses Structural Equation Modelling to analyse data from 220 Italian police and 228 English police officers to compare the impact of Perceived Organisational Support (POS) on organisational stress, employees' resilience, and engagement. The findings show that low Perceived Organisational Support (POS) leads to high stress, which then comprises employees' resilience and likely demotivates them from being engaged on the job, explaining approximately half of their engagement. Stress and resilience also mediate the relationship between POS and engagement. COR theory explains that when POS is low, employees perceive a resource loss spiral which compromises their wellbeing, and consequently, police officers' engagement is low. The contribution of this paper is that it shows how organisational support is an integral part of managing emotional labour and therefore demonstrates how the 'Common Good HRM' model has the potential to protect emotional labour more effectively.",art

Moreover, on the basis of signaling theory, we introduced two socio-economic factors to explain when i-deals are most effective in the context of the current study among teachers: municipal child population growth and municipal unemployment. A study among 1,210 teachers in the Netherlands was conducted to test the mediation and moderation model. Results show positive indirect relationships of growth i-deals with motivation to continue working through innovative work behavior, professional development and work engagement, while indirect relationships were negative for accommodative i-deals.

Advances in employment assessment technology have increasingly enabled employers to recruit from around the world by allowing interviewees to respond to live or pre-recorded video or text prompts live or via asynchronous video recordings. Despite their greater scheduling convenience, asynchronous virtual interviews decrease applicants' ability to engage in impression management and relationship building and therefore may negatively impact applicant reactions compared to their synchronous counterparts. Further, national culture has the potential to influence reactions to virtual interview synchronicity. Previous research has yielded mixed results, with some studies suggesting that culture can moderate how applicants react to selection tests and some finding little or no effect. Drawing from applicant reactions and media richness theories, we integrate Hofstede's cultural dimensions to investigate the role of national culture in applicant reactions to virtual interview synchronicity in a sample of 644,905 virtual interviewees from 46 countries. Overall, our findings demonstrate that, though they rated both highly, interviewees around the world were generally more satisfied with synchronous virtual interviews and found them to be more effective than asynchronous virtual interviews.

While the links between High Performance Work Systems (HPWS) and performance are established, we extend this literature by (1) focusing on new products/services innovation and (2) testing relationships on SMEs (up to 250 employees). Specifically, we test a path model whereby HPWS influences human capital and ultimately innovation. Furthermore, to better understand potential resource differences within SMEs of different size, and the business environment context operated in, we also test (3) firm size and (4) competitive rivalry as moderators. Combining these factors, we test moderated mediation models and use a sample of 253 SMEs with time-lagged data. Findings show HPWS are positively related to a firm's human capital and innovation, and the direct effect of HPWS is partially mediated by human capital. Moderation effects highlight that firm size is most important, with larger SMEs outperforming smaller SMEs only when they have high HPWS. Greater competitive rivalry in conjunction with HPWS (2-way) and for larger SMEs (3-way) produces the highest levels of human capital. Finally, a moderated mediation effect is found for firm size, showing that the indirect effect of HPWS on innovation (through human capital) strengthens as SMEs get larger. The implications for HPWS and SME innovation are discussed.",art

Our study examines the role digitalisation plays in how various stakeholder groups (HR and line managers) identify talent and whether digitalisation transforms the role of HR professionals in identifying talent. By employing a qualitative case study with multiple embedded units of analysis, we show how the same digital talent management technology produced different ways of identifying talent even within the one organisation. In one social context, the material properties of the technology dominated, while in another the existing social context and relationships prevailed over the material properties of the technology. Our findings have implications for understanding digital transformations by acknowledging what factors influence the role that digitalisation and automation have on the perceived legitimacy of HR professionals. We discuss these implications for talent management scholarship and the HR profession.",art
10.1177/23409444211002218,"CSR and corporate taxes: Substitutes or complements?. There is a debate in academia and the business world on whether tax payments should be considered part of firms' social responsibility. Existing literature provides conflicting evidence on the relationship between corporate tax payments and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Borrowing a concept from a behavioral theory of the firm (BTOF), this study attempts to present a more refined model on the relationship between the two. The results in this study reveal that as firms' performance rises further above their aspiration level, they are less likely to show better CSR performances and are also less likely to avoid taxes. Firms performing just above their aspiration level show higher CSR performances and firms performing nearby (both below and above) their aspiration level avoid more taxes. In conclusion, firms' CSR and tax payment decisions are related to the desire to meet or beat an aspiration level or sustain competitive advantage than being ethical or unethical.JEL CLASSIFICATION M14; H26",art

Although organisations rely on employer brands, knowledge regarding management practices used to convince internal stakeholders from such engagements is limited. Consequently, this study examines employer brand manager's legitimacy work. Building on structuration theory, it details the management actions taken to secure approval and structural reasons justifying an organisation's engagement with employer brands. Using data from 69 organisations in Austria, this study evaluates how conviction regarding employer branding policies and measures emerged and identifies five key management practices: dramatising, radicalising, distributing, pragmatizing, demonstrating. These practices underscore contextuality in legitimacy work, illustrating how managers adapt their strategies to different phases in employer branding. This study contributes to existing literature by clarifying the legitimacy issues in intra-organisational management of employer brands, expanding our understanding of organisational politics and the role of structures in employer brand management. Additionally, it offers practical insights to help employer brand managers navigate the complexities of their roles more effectively and gain support for their initiatives by using pioneer, partner, and follower strategies.",art

Typically, while the intersection of these domains is established as either being detrimental (i.e. work-family conflict) or beneficial (i.e. work-family enrichment), we argue there is a fundamental issue with timing. Specifically, we offer zigzag working as an approach to understanding how work and family interact. We suggest, rather than roles operating separately (e.g. work to family or family to work), the reality of work is where employees have work and family roles intersecting simultaneously. We believe this provides unique insights for those with dependent responsibilities, representing potentially both a unique challenge and benefit. Our study has two samples (n = 318 employees and n = 373 managers) and we find support for zigzag working at the day-level and while it is positively related to work-family conflict dimensions it is also positively related to happiness. Overall, our paper offers a new lens on work-family border negotiation, providing empirical evidence showing that zigzag working does occur and that it appears to have unique properties. Importantly, zigging and zagging around work and dependents during a typical day represents both positive and negative effects, highlighting a unique occurrence within the literature.",art

The rapid development of internet technology has enabled organizations to implement flexible work arrangements (FWA) on a large scale. The COVID-19 global pandemic has further intensified this trend, making FWA a vital aspect of HRM to maintain organizational operations. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the causes of FWA utilization and implement effective strategies to achieve optimal outcomes. We propose a framework for FWA utilization antecedents based on the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model and test it using meta-analysis. Drawing on 104 studies (108 independent samples) with 1,034,603 participants, we examine the relationship between FWA utilization and its job-related antecedents. Our findings generally support the expected relationships across two categories of FWA antecedents, namely job resources and job demands. We also identify demographics and masculinity/femininity culture as moderators that influence these relationships. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and practical implications to guide HR managers in developing effective FWA strategies that meet the needs of both employees and organizations.",art

Although 'brain drain' from emerging economies is a well-documented problem, research on how Human Resource Management (HRM) can potentially address it is still scarce. Based on Signaling Theory, we argue that developmental HRM practices in home countries reduce self-initiated expatriation (SIE) of young healthcare professionals by increasing their focus on opportunities in their home country. Additionally, we hypothesize that individual financial stability as a personal resource constitutes an important boundary condition, as developmental HRM's positive effect on the focus on opportunities and its indirect negative effect on SIE intention may be even stronger for individuals with lower financial resources. We tested and found support for our hypotheses using a sample of 184 junior doctors in Lithuania in a time-lagged study. By bridging the HRM and SIE literature, our study extends the existing knowledge about the outcomes of HRM and highlights the importance of home country HRM in explaining SIE intention above and beyond its traditionally considered antecedents. In this way, our study has major theoretical and practical implications for decision-makers at organizational and national levels in managing brain drain from emerging economies.",art

Recent research on green human resource management suggests that the social exchange process is conducive to employees behaving pro-environmentally. Previous studies have focused exclusively on reciprocal exchange and have largely overlooked the possibility that negotiated exchange also occurs. In this paper, a research model is developed to test whether the effect of green human resource management on employee eco-initiatives through the mediation of supervisory support for the environment is conditioned by felt responsibility for change and negotiated exchanges. Using data from a two-wave study, the findings show that the mediating effect is stronger at high levels of negotiated exchange only for employees displaying low levels of felt responsibility for change. The results also indicate that negotiated exchanges do not intervene in the case of employees exhibiting high levels of felt responsibility for change. This study provides new insights for understanding how social exchange operates in an environmental sustainability context.",art

The various rhetorics of 'agile', 'agility', and 'agile working' (AW) set an agenda for new ways of working and have recently gained traction in popular management discourse, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet conceptually, these rhetorical varieties of 'agile' are underdeveloped in the academic literature. In this article we examine the stream of AW as being a particularly influential rhetoric. AW is critically evaluated by first identifying separate streams and rhetorics of 'agile' in the literature, and AW is then situated within this typology. To understand the particular version of reality being mainstreamed by the AW rhetoric, we then examine AWs conceptualisation as 'a new way of working', as promoted by dominant actors within the UK work context. We then consider existing studies of worker experiences under different employment arrangements that can be subsumed under the heading of 'AW practices'. Our analysis highlights voids between what may be considered as mainstream HR practice when applied to standard employees compared to a spectrum of 'non-standard' workers. The implications for the role of HR in the implementation of AW and in managing the worker experience are discussed and future avenues for this under-researched area are offered.",art

We find the extant literature characterised by context-specific studies featuring considerable variety in terms of levels of analysis, theory, and content. Using the notion of perceived employability, key themes in the literature are identified and presented in an integrative framework. The framework encompasses individual, organisational, occupational, and institutional components of the perceived employability of SMs, different forms of work transition and associated mediators (broadening strategies) and moderators (transition conditions). Proposing adoption of process thinking for future research, suggestions regarding the interaction of individual and contextual components of perceived employability and the mediation and moderation mechanisms in the process of work transition are outlined.",art

The present study examines a serial mediation model based on conservation of resources theory, in which empowering leadership predicts the nature of work-family interfaces via work engagement and work reflection. The examination of work reflection extends prior research on the work-family interface and allows for testing the effects of resources created in the workplace (e.g., empowering leader behaviors and work engagement) on family life. Three waves of data over a six-month time period were obtained from 274 full-time U.S. employees. Structural equation modeling and bootstrapping assessed the mediating effects of work engagement and reflection about work. The results generally supported the mediation model, but mainly for positive reflection. It showed that empowering leaders led to subordinates experiencing positive work-to-family spillover because they promoted subordinates' work engagement and positive reflection about their work experiences. Although work engagement also led to less negative work reflection, that mediator did not have additional unique effects on work-to-family spillover. Only indirect effects through engagement and positive reflection were found; there were no direct effects. Overall, the study contributed to understanding the underlying cognitive mechanisms explaining the positive link between empowering leadership and work-family facilitation.",art

The influence of upward social comparison on the intention to work abroad among doctors in Iraq: the mediating mechanism of attitude towards leaving. The primary objective of the study was to verify the possibility that social comparisons occurred between professionals (i.e. doctors) in their country of origin to similar others in different hospitals, healthcare systems, and countries. In addition, this study also examined whether these social comparisons resulted in an intention to work abroad among these professionals who remained in their home country. On a sample of 450 Iraqi doctors, we used Structural Equation Modeling through partial least squares (PLS-SEM) to analyse the data. Our study found that upward comparison and attitude towards leaving positively affected the intention to work abroad among doctors who remained in Iraq. Further, the relationship between upward comparison and intention to work abroad was mediated by attitude towards leaving. Our study extends the brain drain literature by examining the role of social comparison, specifically upward comparison, in the migration of professionals and how such a comparison leads to intention to work abroad. The implications for theory and practices to reduce such a comparison among professionals are discussed.",art

Ideas about regulatory pluralism provided an intellectual foundation for the post-1980s transformation in regulatory frameworks from predominantly state-centric regulation to a growing emphasis on the alternative regulations now abundant in HRM and IHRM. Regulatory pluralism, which maintains that a diversity of alternative regulatory institutions and tools provide more responsive, relevant and legitimate regulation than traditional state regulation, emerged alongside the political ascendancy of neoliberalism. Recent IHRM research on global supply chain regulation largely explains weaknesses in non-nation-state forms of regulation in terms of the relationships of power and commitment among stakeholders and other contextual factors. This article argues that the theory of regulatory pluralism, can contribute both to an understanding and critique of how the growing profusion of regulatory forms populating various HR functions impacts on the quality of HRM policy and practice. The article's empirical focus is on the national setting, and in particular, regulatory frameworks applying to OHS management. We argue that a pluralist mix of regulators, often overlapping and competing, is less effective in achieving policy objectives and normative change in HRM, than traditional state-oriented regulation.",art

Our study aims to investigate if perceived green human resource management (HRM) practices can foster green creativity among employees via dual mediation paths of green crafting and harmonious environmental passion. A two-wave survey process was conducted to garner responses from 712 employees and 106 managers from tour operators operating in Vietnam. Results revealed the mediating roles of green crafting and harmonious environmental passion for the linkage between perceived green HRM practices and employee green creativity.

HR professionals have been widely ignored in the Human Resource (HR) management literature pertaining to small and medium-sized enterprises (SME). Given that entrepreneurs may be reluctant to hire HR professionals, it is important to investigate the value that HR people may bring to an SME. Addressing this literature gap, our research draws on resource orchestration theory (ROT) to link the interaction between HR professionals' human and social capital to firm performance via the use of high-performance work practices (HPWPs). Further, this relationship depends on the SME's size: in small firms, the link is strengthened because HR professionals' human and social capital is more likely to create a competitive advantage in a context of resource poverty. We test the research model among a sample of 174 Canadian SMEs with fewer than 250 employees. Our results show that HR professionals' human and social capital is more closely related to firm performance through the adoption of HPWPs in small SMEs than in large ones. Overall, our study highlights the value that HR professionals bring to small SMEs and advocates for a greater presence of HR professionals in SMEs.",art

Talent designation is one of the most sensitive and controversial topics in talent management. As organisations adopt workforce differentiation practices, a subset of employees is often considered 'talent', while other employees may implicitly perceive 'non-talent' status. Taking a social comparison perspective, we examine under which conditions employees are more likely to respond positively or negatively to perceived non-talent designation. Specifically, we draw on research on personal goals and extend the self-evaluation maintenance model. We argue that, contrary to common assumptions, perceived non-talent designation may not universally cause negative responses. Comparison can be experienced as inspiration or envy - depending on the relevance of talent status to one's identity, attainability of talent status in the future, and a multitude of micro-, meso-, and macro-level contextual factors. This, in turn, shapes both employees' approach motivation to gain talent status and self-serving attributions to defend non-talent status. In doing so, we provide a more nuanced understanding of employee reactions to perceived non-talent designation and highlight the value of dynamic talent designation in organisations.",art

This study is an empirical account of how line managers evaluate the performance of their subordinates in the context of mobile telework. Whilst the increasing use of new technologies affords certain advantages for line managers in remote performance evaluation (PE), it also results in a greater volume, fragmentation and variety of performance data, which can be challenging to manage. Adopting an attention-based view (ABV), we shed light on the role of technology in PE, elaborating on the kinds of attentional stimuli that are generated by technology as part of the broader socio-technical work environment, and how these together with the attentional perspectives of the manager influence attentional engagement, i.e. what managers direct their time, energy and effort on in PE. Our focus is on attention as something line managers do, in their immediate context. We contribute to the remote work and PE literature by showing how the interplay between two drivers of attentional engagement: attentional stimuli (different possible foci of attention in the external environment) and managers' own attentional perspectives (the cognitive and motivational structures that influence what stimuli receive attention) influence the attentional engagement in PE of mobile teleworkers.",art

While it is known that high-quality human resource management (HRM) contributes to organizational performance, the process through which individual outcomes are influenced is understudied. Further, not all HRM practices are similarly influential in making impact on performance. We introduce and empirically test a theoretical model that explores the mechanism through which discretionary HRM practices influence employees' attitudes and behaviors. Employing a three-wave dataset collected from full-time employees (478 employees in Time 1, 266 employees in Time 2, and 235 employees in Time 3), we identify the mediating role of career satisfaction and organizational identification and the moderating role of work engagement as relevant factors in the relationship between perceived discretionary HRM practices and employees' knowledge sharing behavior and turnover intentions. The analysis, based on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), has validated the proposed model. The theoretical contribution we offer expands the understanding of role of HRM in shaping work behaviors and outcomes. The study identifies the unique impact of perceived discretionary HR practices on individual and organizational factors, in particular, the important issue of knowledge sharing. The major added value we bring to the literature is about the relevance and impact of discretionary HR practices and the implications it offers to HRM and line managers. Using the findings, organizations can tailor HRM system to fit their position and characteristics and develop 'best practice' to fit their needs.",art

Human resource (HR) process research refers to the way HR practices are communicated in organisations, including the way these HR practices are understood (i.e. perceived HR strength) and attributed (i.e. HR attributions) by employees. Previous research has mainly focused on the outcomes of the HR process, while research that examines both antecedents and employee outcomes is relatively rare. This is especially the case for imprinting factors, defined as the hereditary and family-related influences, non-work contextual factors, and cultural values that may affect the way employees understand and attribute HR in their organisation. To further explore this relatively new area of research, this paper provides a systematic review of 19 empirical studies that investigate the role of imprinting factors in HR process research. Through the application of an imprinting framework with HR content and HR process theories, this review is orientated around the development of an integrative conceptual framework that elaborates on how, when, and to what degree imprinting factors influence the effect of bundles of HR practices on perceived HR strength and HR attributions and, as a consequence, employee outcomes.

In this article, we combine insights from basic psychological needs theory and the social identity approach to propose that perceptions of organizational support enhance the basic need satisfaction of employees with disabilities, which yields higher levels of task performance. We also suggest that disability group identification strengthens this mediational process. We tested our hypotheses with two quantitative field studies that were conducted in France and based on matched employee-supervisor data. Using a sample of employees working in companies that specialize in the employment of persons with disabilities, Study 1 aimed to provide initial evidence for the mediating role of basic need satisfaction. Study 2 aimed to replicate the findings of Study 1 in less specific contexts while testing the moderating role of disability group identification. Next, the methodological limitations of these investigations were addressed in two quantitative post hoc studies.

Whereas open innovation has gained wide recognition in the innovation management field, as firms open their boundaries to knowledge inflow and outflow to advance innovation, very few empirical papers link the HRM literature to this phenomenon. We base our analysis on an exploratory qualitative study of the pharmaceutical corporation AstraZeneca and its implementation of an open innovation initiative called BioVentureHub. We identify three main areas of HRM work: inbound, outbound, and coupled HRM work. Furthermore, we illustrate how these HRM activities relate to the development of the open innovation initiative and to current HRM and open innovation literature. The framework identifies HRM activities that target not only internal employees, but also external human resources engaged in the open innovation initiative. This HRM work is mainly conducted through informal means, separate from the host corporation's business as usual. Our empirical study contributes to the limited and mainly conceptual research connecting open innovation with HRM, increasing our knowledge of how corporations use HRM work to manage open innovation initiatives in practice.",art

Troubled by increasing uncertainty in the business environment, many organizations have a strong need to become agile. There are indications that agility-oriented characteristics of employees, often referred to as workforce agility, play a key role in this regard. This paper systematically reviews the academic literature on employee agility, with an emphasis on conceptualization, operationalization, and the special role of human resource management (HRM) in shaping it. Our study finds that construct clarity, theoretical foundation, and rigor in operationalization are not yet well established, and that the role of HRM is under-researched. In order to pave the way for future research, we clarify the understanding of the employee agility concept and suggest a new definition resulting from our theoretical discussion. We embed this conceptualization in a newly suggested framework which is rooted in the work stressor framework. It links employee agility to the job demands of a dynamic environment, and outlines the role of flexibility-promoting HR practices. As such, we explicitly refer to a dynamic lens on person-environment (P-E) fit theory. Furthermore, through the suggested conceptualization of employee agility and the theory-based framework, we amplify existing theory.

This study focuses on the relationships between social power and recruitment discrimination in organizations. We examine how individuals in different hierarchical positions in organizations in France intentionally discriminate in their recruitment practices through various means of circumventing internal and external anti-discrimination policies. Social power theory is used as a theoretical framework.Twenty-eight semi-structured in-depth interviews with individuals involved in recruitment in France were conducted, transcribed and analyzed.The findings reveal two distinct strategies used to intentionally discriminate in recruitment. One strategy concentrates on outsourcing recruitment actions. In doing so, organizations can effectively divert the responsibility of upholding anti-discrimination rules and regulations to an outside party. In this strategy, the use of unwritten codes and external pressure (or the threat thereof) are employed so that the outside recruitment agency understands that it is to follow the client's wishes over the law, which relates to coercive power. The second strategy focuses on conducting covertly controlled in-house recruitment through the use of differential and legitimate power to overrule decisions, make use of vague and complex laws, or use costs and administrative difficulties as potential business reasons which may permit discrimination.We add to a growing body of research on recruitment discrimination and power.",art

This article aims to inspire international human resource management (IHRM) scholarship that incorporates postcolonial feminist theory, using the under-researched topic of paternalistic leadership and gender to illustrate the opportunities and challenges such an endeavour can present. Paternalistic leadership is an important and widely used indigenous framework for examining leadership in Chinese contexts, while postcolonial feminism holds the capacity to problematise the representation of non-western women in feminist theory as a universal, transhistorical category. As this article demonstrates, postcolonial feminist theory centralises cultural difference in theorising gender, strives toward shattering binaries reproduced by colonialism and imperialism (West/East, Western/Third World Woman) and generates indigenous, localised knowledge on non-western women. Three sites of enquiry are discussed: 1) Chinese feminisms and genders; 2) Chinese cultures and gender norms; 3) Voice, agency and the subaltern woman. This article provides research propositions for IHRM scholars to translate postcolonial femininst theory into research on paternalistic leadership and gender.

The results show that daily work engagement mediates the relationship between emotional stability and creativity, while the direct effect of emotional stability on creativity and the mediating role of daily positive affect in this relationship are not supported. Furthermore, paradoxical leadership was found to moderate the indirect effects of emotional stability on creativity via daily positive affect and daily work engagement, with significant indirect effects when paradoxical leadership was high but not when it was low. Important theoretical and practical implications to the extant literature on creativity and leadership are discussed.",art

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) of MNE subsidiaries in emerging markets has mainly been studied through aggregated CSR activities. Instead, this study disaggregates CSR engagement towards target groups into two foci - External and Internal CSR - depending on whether such engagement is outside or within the organization. We explored whether the odds of a wholly owned subsidiary matching its parent's choice of target groups - for both External and Internal CSR - varied by which organizational cohort it belonged to, based on organizational characteristics. Results of logistic regressions indicate that age of a subsidiary, relative size of the subsidiary and region-of-origin of its parent influence the odds of the subsidiary following its parent's External CSR focus; while age of a subsidiary, global presence of its parent, and industry type influence the odds of the subsidiary following its parent's Internal CSR focus. Findings indicate that both through External and Internal CSR, MNE subsidiaries simultaneously pursue legitimacy and competitive advantage, through different primary stakeholder groups, to address both host country and global institutional contexts.",art

Although creativity is an important domain of performance in turbulent environments, little research has examined through which underlying mediating mechanism and when HR practices are effective in facilitating creative task performance. Building on the conservation of resources theory, we aimed to (1) investigate whether opportunity-enhancing HR practices were positively linked to employee creativity through work engagement and (2) examine the roles of two new boundary conditions (i.e. proactive personality and work autonomy) in these relationships. To test our predictions, a sample of 282 Dutch employees was surveyed using a three-wave lagged survey design. The findings obtained from regression-based path analyses demonstrated that, as expected, work engagement served as a mediator between HR practices and creativity. Moreover, the results indicated that a proactive personality was found to amplify the positive association between HR practices and work engagement. Additionally, work autonomy was found to amplify both the positive association between work engagement and creativity, as well as the indirect association between HR practices and creativity mediated by work engagement. These findings reveal that organizations can enhance employees' creative performance by implementing HR practices that empower and involve employees, while simultaneously cultivating work engagement, proactive personality traits, and autonomy in the workplace.",art

The increase in mental ill-health amongst the working population presents a serious challenge for organisations. Line-managers are an important provider of support to staff with psychological distress (PD), their experiences however, are under-researched. In response, we interviewed 15 line-managers from the private, public, and voluntary sector about their support provision to subordinates with PD. Drawing upon workplace social support and boundary management theory we explored line-manager confidence, boundaries of the manager/subordinate relationship, and how they navigate the competing demands of their role. We found that organisational psychosocial climate and context are key factors: a stressful or demanding working environment, and/or unsupportive colleagues can undermine the capacity of line-managers to provide social support. Theoretical contributions include focusing on the provider, rather than recipient, of social support and integrating social support and boundary management theory. Practical recommendations include removing the onus on line-managers to provide support and advocating shared organisational responsibility for support from multiple sources, underpinned by a wider remit of policies and procedures. This paper includes line-manager narratives around employee mental ill-health including reference to suicide, that some readers may find distressing.",art

As the modern workforce is increasingly aging and age-diverse, helping older workers maintain a positive state at work is theoretically and practically imperative. Due to the heterogeneity of individuals' aging trajectories, self-initiated job crafting may be a more effective approach for older workers to manage their roles. However, limited research has addressed this critical issue systematically. Drawing on the job demands-resources model and conservation of resources theory, we examine whether role overload, skill training, and their joint effect influence older workers' job crafting behaviors, which, in turn, increase their work engagement. Our results from a multi-wave study provide support for the significant influence of role overload, skill training, and their joint effect. Specifically, role overload facilitated older workers' negative crafting behaviors (i.e., reducing demands), and skill training stimulated their positive crafting behaviors (i.e., seeking resources and seeking challenges). The results of the interaction between role overload and skill training indicated that when older workers have access to adequate skill training, role overload positively influences seeking resources and seeking challenges, and negatively influences reducing demands. Furthermore, the interaction between role overload and skill training influenced older workers' work engagement through seeking resources and seeking challenges.",art

Research to date creates a predominantly positive image of idiosyncratic deals (i-deals). However, since i-deals lead to differences in employment relationships, they can trigger perceptions of unfairness and negative reactions among co-workers, thereby posing a threat to the overall effectiveness of i-deals. Against this background, it is important to gain more insights into how co-workers' perceptions of distributive justice are shaped. Building on distributive justice theory and integrating distributive justice principles with the roles of emotions and personality, this study investigates three factors that are likely to influence co-workers' perceptions of the distributive justice of an i-deal: the i-deal's content, the negotiation's timing, and co-workers' justice sensitivity. The results of the vignette-based, between-subjects quasi-experimental study with 650 employees show that these three factors influence co-workers' perceptions of an i-deal's distributive justice. In addition, the results of the study reveal interaction effects between the factors under investigation. By examining what influences co-workers' perceptions of distributive justice, this study contributes to a better understanding of i-deals from a third-party perspective and highlights that some types of i-deals, in terms of content and timing, should be approached with particular caution by supervisors.",art

This study examines the configuration of international HRM strategies to understand how an MNE pursues global integration and local responsiveness simultaneously in HRM. Drawing upon cases of eight South Korean and Japanese MNEs, we identify different patterns of configuration of five international HRM strategies that shape distinct sets of activities. We show that the firms pursue global integration and local responsiveness simultaneously, but in distinct ways, by configuring international HRM strategies for both integration and responsiveness rather than solely just relying on either one. Our findings offer insight into how MNEs actually manage the duality of global integration and local responsiveness at the strategy level beyond the hybridization of global standardization and localization of practices.",art

Career identity development, involving exploration and commitment, is a lifelong process by an individual that is fundamental to shaping one's career. Although prior research has investigated what may lead one to develop a strong and clear career identity, there is limited understanding of the cultural influences on career identity development relevant to multicultural individuals. Integrating the identity status paradigm with a narrative identity perspective, we propose that career identity development interplays with multicultural identity development. We explore this interplay through in-depth interviews with Chinese-ethnic multicultural individuals. From the interviews, we elucidate a typology (Multicultural-Career Identity Interplay, 'MCII') to explain how multicultural identity and career identity development are interrelated in systematic ways (Commanding, Cruising, and Contending), and introduce a dual-dimensional, relational-oriented framework of career paths. We explain how each MCII pattern corresponds to individual career paths and is associated with immigration age. Our study extends career identity development theory into the cultural identity domain, providing a more nuanced understanding of the dynamic and culturally influenced career development of multicultural individuals. The findings can help individuals and career counsellors better understand and support the career identity development of individuals who identify with more than one culture.",art

Despite recent progress, the literature is still unclear on the internal determinants of employee-related corporate social responsibility (CSR), particularly regarding the effect of the chief executive officer (CEO). Integrating upper echelons theory with the social class literature, this study examines how CEO social class perception influences private firms' employee-related CSR. Based on a unique dataset from the Nationwide Private Firms Survey of China, this study empirically shows that higher CEO social class perception promotes a higher level of employee-related CSR activities in private firms. Additionally, this positive impact of CEO social class perception on employee-related CSR is amplified among younger firms and firms that face higher market munificence. Our study contributes to the current literature by enriching our understanding of the antecedents of employee-related CSR from the perspective of the CEO's cognition of his or her social class and revealing the related informative boundary conditions.",art

Drawing on the appraisal theory of emotions and domain specificity perspective, we explore why and when work-to-family conflict leads to unethical pro-family behavior in the workplace. In particular, we propose that work-to-family conflict reinforces unethical pro-family behavior via employee felt guilt. Further, supervisor support for family issues attenuates the relationship between work-to-family conflict and felt guilt, whereas perceived forgiveness climate strengthens the relationship between felt guilt and unethical pro-family behavior. Two time-lagged field studies conducted in Pakistan and China supported our hypotheses. Study 1 demonstrated that work-to-family guilt mediated the relationship between work-to-family conflict and unethical pro-family behavior. Study 2 replicated these findings and provided additional support for our boundary conditions. Specifically, supervisor support for family issues buffered the positive effect of work-to-family conflict on work-to-family guilt; perceived forgiveness climate amplified the positive effect of work-to-family guilt on unethical pro-family behavior.

Based on a sample of 261 employees from a food chain company (Study 1) and 259 employees from 43 organizations (Study 2), we identified a direct relationship between SRHRM and employee WGB and an indirect relationship mediated by learning goal orientation and moral identity. Additionally, coworker support moderated the effects of SRHRM on learning goal orientation and moral identity. These conclusions provide a new entry point for exploring why SRHRM affects employee WGB.",art

Building on and expanding prior research, we develop lines of reasoning to suggest that virtuality negatively affects team failure learning. Additionally, we argue that team LMX quality and team LMX differentiation can help mitigate this effect. We test our hypotheses based on survey data from 73 teams working for a service unit at an international bank. In line with our theorizing, the results reveal that virtuality hampers team failure learning. Moreover, we find that team LMX quality and team LMX differentiation can serve to alleviate the negative consequences of virtuality.

Governments across the Arabian Gulf aim to reduce their dependence on expatriates by implementing localisation policies. Building on institutional and legitimacy theories, we seek to advance our understanding of the effects of such policies on multinational enterprises (MNEs). We used data from 157 MNEs operating in Saudi Arabia and found the indigenisation of the human resource management (HRM) function is closely correlated with the level of workforce localisation: key factors empowering localisation, defined as recruitment and training practices geared towards the needs of locals, include the demographics and role of the HRM Director. Theoretically, we contribute to the literature on institutionalism and legitimacy by revealing how various institutional forces influence the process of selection and transfer of HRM practices to adapt to the institutional environment of a given context. Our research also shows that if MNEs follow government recommendations, develop links with local educational institutions to target suitable job candidates, and adapt to shortages in local skills and competencies by investing in the training and development of local workers, they will be more likely to achieve success in workforce localisation and legitimacy.",art

Advances in information and communications technology have contributed to the spread of telework, which has been underway since the early 2000s. During the COVID-19 pandemic, telework became more than just an alternative to the traditional office: it became a strategic means of survival for many companies. Given its importance, in the last two decades, the scientific community has shown increased interest in the factors that affect successful telework. However, knowledge on this subject remains fragmented and disparate. This study aims to synthesise the literature on successful telework and consolidate its success factors into a framework that provides conceptual and holistic knowledge on the topic. Our findings demonstrate that telework is affected by factors categorised into five groups: technological materials, non-technological materials, teleworkers, teleworker work environment and teleworker family environment. A number of these factors has causal links, while some have become irrelevant and given way to new factors over time. Some have been confirmed to have an overall positive effect on telework. In addition to proposing a theoretical perspective and future research avenues, this study presents some HRM implications to help managers and policymakers make telework more effective.",art

Responding to calls for further investigation of the HRM 'black box', our paper examines how psychosocial safety climate (PSC), an important but understudied form of organizational climate, mediates the relationship between ability, motivation and opportunity (AMO)-enhancing HPWPs and service recovery performance (SRP). We conducted a quantitative survey amongst flight attendants in Canada, Germany and France, which yielded 1664 valid answers. Using AMOS software V.24, the structural equation method was used to test our model. The method of Monte Carlo (parametric bootstrap) and more precisely bias corrected percentile method was used to test the mediation mechanism, based on 5,000 bootstrapping and 95% confidence intervals. Our results show that each AMO-enhancing HR bundle directly influences PSC and indirectly influences SRP via PSC. They also reveal a direct relationship between PSC and SRP.",art

Models of expatriate adjustment grounded in person-environment fit theory argue expatriate adjustment occurs when the expatriate's abilities meet the demands of the cultural context and when the cultural context fulfils the expatriate's needs. However, the process of how an expatriate's abilities match the demands of the cultural context and how the expatriate's needs interact with these demands is less explored. Addressing this gap, we take an acculturation approach to build on the premise of person-environment fit theory by presenting a conceptual model that shows how an expatriate's ability to draw upon certain personality traits may influence the adoption of certain acculturation strategies needed to meet the demands of the cultural context across life domains. In this sense, an expatriate is able to meet the demands of his/her cultural context across life domains by adopting certain acculturation strategies. Moreover, we posit the importance of an expatriate's needs as represented by his/her acculturation attitudes with these demands. We contribute to the expatriate literature by extending the premise of person-environment fit theory in expatriate adjustment and by connecting personality traits with an expatriate's acculturation strategies.",art

Autonomy and fit with the job are important reasons why employees thrive at work, yet surprisingly little research has examined the implications this may have on how employees perceive their career opportunities, both within and outside the organization where they currently work. Drawing on self-determination theory, we propose that the more employees manage their career in a self-directed manner, the more likely they are to consider themselves to have good career opportunities both within and outside their current organization. However, we propose that, while good person-job fit may push an employee to see increasing opportunities within their current organization, it is equally likely to make the employee less inclined to see opportunities for career advancement outside the organization. Analyses on data gathered from a sample of 902 knowledge workers support our model. We conclude that person-job fit strongly influences the degree to which employees perceive opportunities for internal and external career mobility. The results have implications for research on self-directed career management, person-job fit, and the dynamics of the career mobility issue.",art

An intra-organizational change process involving all middle managers was studied in a public sector organization in Sweden over three time points, spanning two years in total. Using sensemaking and the person-environmental fit literature as well studies on promotion and demotion, hypotheses about the effects of managerial status loss and being offered a non-preferred role (non-preference) on change reactions (job satisfaction, turnover intentions, mental health) are made. Data from 140 middle managers was analyzed with path models, where two process factors (perceived organizational support during the change, procedural justice of the change) and two job characteristics (job demand, job control) were tested simultaneously as mediators. Results revealed that managerial status loss had negative effects on work attitudes but mental health was positively affected over time through decreased job demands. Non-preference had negative consequences for all outcome variables and these effects were mediated through lower procedural justice of the change, lower job control, and for some outcomes, lower perceived organizational support during the change. The results provide insight into how middle managers react to change, and suggest that process justice and job characteristics play an important part in shaping these reactions.",art

Researchers in the field of HRM and Strategic HRM have for several decades engaged in research endeavours to identify the link between HR investments and firm performance. Despite this, the field still has some way to go to definitively demonstrate this causal relationship; partly due to the cross-sectional nature of much of this research. In the current paper, we give a brief overview of the SHRM field and the benefits that the new subfield of People Analytics (PA) might bring to the area. We also conduct a brief survey of research in Insider Econometrics, an approach used in Personnel Economics to produce empirical estimates of the value of HR practices, to highlight longitudinal intra-firm research in economics that could provide insights to research exploring the HR investment-performance link (important in both SHRM and PA fields). We discuss the value of combining the business impact perspective of People Analytics that has a unique 'inside' (intra-firm) position, with the longitudinal intra-firm analysis approaches utilized in Insider Econometrics. We suggest that People Analytics researchers, who are able to draw on the theoretical developments in HRM field, would benefit from exploring existing research insights and methodological techniques used within the field of Insider Econometrics.",art

Nowadays organizations are increasingly engaged in talent management, because it allows firms to grow rapidly by leveraging on human capital. Most antecedent studies focused on expectations and motivations of talents living in developed countries. Though, a little is known about career expectations of talents in emerging economies, and whether they diverge from those of developed countries or not. However, this information might be of use for several motives. First, emerging countries have a high growth rate. Second, these talents may be effectively harnessed from domestic and non-domestic firms, depending on whether their expectations are met or not. Consistently, this study aims at exploring the career expectations of individuals in emerging countries, by capturing the heterogeneity of expectations between emerging and developed countries due to cultural, politic, economic, and religious differences. As a matter of fact, emerging countries are frequently characterized by low levels of both income and employment, differently from many developed countries. For such motives and because of the absence of valid employment alternatives, talents might be more willing to engage in entrepreneurial initiatives rather than attempting to be employed in an organization. Thus, the primary intent of this explorative study is to understand what are the factors that affect career expectations of talents in emerging countries. Consistently, a cross-sectional principal component analysis (PCA) was used for hypotheses testing. The sample refers to a set of African countries, based on data availability for 2019. Data used for the analysis are drawn from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) and they refer to individual entrepreneurial behaviours and attitudes. Notably, findings show that career expectations of talents are driven by motivation and opportunity, especially in the male groups. However, the study also originally shows that the need for achievement and the willingness to stand out are the main drivers of talents' expectations. In a nutshell, talents may prefer independence over the employment status. Implications of the findings, at a business level, suggest that companies in emerging markets should revisit their talent management strategy in order to avoid the loss of many talented employees. As instance, they should grant more independence, raise the income, and favour internal and female entrepreneurship. Thereby, the original findings of the study contribute both theoretically and practically to the research domain by specifying that career needs of talented people vary according to context and time.",art

While there is now an extensive body of literature on employee voice behaviour in the global North, research evidence from the global South is limited. This has constrained our understanding of the barriers that female workers face in expressing their views and concerns in developing countries such as Nigeria. This article examines the cultural factors that shape female employee voice behaviour in Nigerian workplaces. Using a meta-synthesis of 52 semi-structured interviews and approximately 200 h of non-participant observation, we identify a high-power distance orientation and patriarchal norms as two cultural factors that contribute to gender imbalance in the workplace, making it difficult for female employees to express their opinions, suggestions, ideas, or complaints about important workplace issues. Our findings highlight a system of patriarchal hegemony and gender inequality that makes voice behaviour difficult for female workers. The findings also show that contextualised religious norms and teachings encourage silence among female employees. We provide valuable insights into the cultural norms that inhibit female employee voice behaviour in the Global South context.",art

This article examines the cases of five Sri Lankan export-oriented companies, each situated within global production networks (GPN) with British companies at the apex. In examining their managerial practices, a strong similarity to the practices associated with Anglo-Saxon paternalism is identified. However, these observed parallels are a product of local circumstances and the particular location within the GPN rather than a consequence of any emulation of British practices. The resulting system reflects a high power-dependency relationship that employers hold over employees. In this sense, the emergent HR system is partly dependent on the position in the GPN and partly autonomous. The system is characterised by a gendered division of labour and by the proximity of managerial oversight over the issue of worker autonomy. The factory setting has lower levels of worker autonomy and dependency compared to tea harvesting. One outlying exception to the general paternalistic approach, in one of the companies studied, is where the religious and ethnic makeup of the workforce is not shared with management, leading to increased conflict with the unionised workforce. The nature of Sri Lankan paternalism is specific and endogenous, but the conditions creating this paternalism are likely to be replicated elsewhere.",art

This article considers the extent to which Active Labour Market Policies (ALMPs) support the sustained inclusion of veterans in the civilian labour market. Drawing on the first in-depth research into veteran's interactions with the UK's Public Employment Services (PES) and other contracted providers, we present analysis of qualitative longitudinal data from 68 veterans. We demonstrate the important role ALMPs play in mediating the employment relationship, showing how veterans claiming out-of-work benefits are typically either 'pushed' towards inappropriate jobs or 'parked' through their exclusion from employment support when deemed unfit for work. This not only exposes veterans and other jobseekers to poor quality work but undermines both job match and inclusive employment practices. Furthermore, the potential for more positive outcomes through engagement with employers and HRM practitioners is not being realised. This is significant for veterans in the UK and beyond, where policymakers make broader commitments to post-Service integration into civilian employment. We critique Work First approaches centred on those deemed work ready and contribute to broader theorisation around interactions between the state and HRM, arguing the need for pluralist approaches which incorporate ALMPs.",art

Based on conservation of resources theory, the present study examines a serial mediation model in which empowering leadership predicts the nature of work-home interfaces via cognitive states and processes (interactional justice and work rumination). Two waves of data with a one-month interval were obtained from 195 full-time Korean employees. Structural equation modeling assessed mediation, first by two forms of interactional justice (interpersonal and informational) and then by two forms of work rumination (positive and negative). The results generally supported the mediation model showing that empowering leaders helped subordinates' work-home enrichment, because they enhanced both interpersonal and informational justice, resulting in positive rumination about their work experiences. Empowering leaders also helped reduce subordinates' work-home conflict through enhancing informational justice, which made employees ruminate less about negative aspects of work during off-job time. Testing alternative models that added more direct paths did not improve model fit. Overall, the study contributed to understanding the underlying cognitive mechanisms explaining the effect of empowering leadership on work-home spillover.",art

An increasing volume of research has examined issues related to working abroad, but studies focusing on low-skilled migrant workers are lagging. Relying on intercultural interaction and social exchange views as overarching frames, we examined determinants of low-skilled immigrant workers' workplace satisfaction. With a sample of 640 migrant workers from eight countries, we specifically examined and compared the effects of cultural and workplace factors. Results showed that intercultural negativity factors such as intercultural rejection sensitivity and intercultural interaction difficulty reduced the workplace satisfaction of low-skilled migrant workers, while social exchange factors such as supervisory support and distributive justice perception boosted their workplace satisfaction. We further found that workplace factors showed significantly stronger effects than cultural factors on their workplace satisfaction. Finally, we examined interaction effects between cultural and workplace factors, and found that the positive effect of supervisory support was greater for those who perceived more cultural difficulty than for those perceiving less cultural difficulty.

Organizations are increasingly aware that a better vocational inclusion of persons with disabilities (PWD) is in their self-interest for reasons such as a shortage of skilled labor, an increasing prevalence of disability in their aging workforces, and changed societal attitudes and laws regarding the promotion of diversity and equity in the workplace. Human resource (HR) practices have been identified as a primary enabler of inclusion, yet research on disability-related HR Management is scattered across disciplines. To provide an evidence-based analysis and integration, this article systematically reviews the literature on HR management in the context of employing persons with disabilities, using the high-performance work practices 'selection and staffing', 'training and development', '(performance) appraisal, promotion, and career management' and 'compensation and benefits' as an organizing framework. We systematically reviewed and summarized the key findings of 74 empirical studies conducted from 1990 through 2020. Most studies focused on selection and staffing practices, providing strong evidence that standardization and structure reduce bias in the appraisal of PWD and related employment decisions. Research regarding appropriate HR practices that allow to utilize, develop and reward PWDs' potential, in contrast, is still in its infancy.",art

Growing concerns of maintaining the best talent have contributed to the rising number of idiosyncratic deals (i-deals) at the workplace. I-deals refer to the personalised work arrangements between employees and their employers where the terms benefit both parties. Despite the acknowledgment that supervisors are key in creating i-deals, research to date has overlooked their role. Drawing on prosocial motives and social learning theory, we explore an overall model of what triggers employee flexibility i-deals and the consequences of such i-deals on employee outcomes. In so doing, we explore one of the key yet untested assumptions of i-deals theory: that they are intended to be mutually beneficial. We investigate our model with matched supervisor - employee data (n = 186) collected in El Salvador and Chile. Findings reveal that there is a positive association between supervisors' prosocial motives and employees' flexibility i-deals. Moreover, prosocial motives of supervisors trickle-down and shape employees' functioning at work (i.e. work performance and deviant behaviours) and lead them to be more prosocially motivated through employees' flexibility i-deals.",art

Drawing on conservation of resources theory, we hypothesize that work alienation promotes knowledge hiding through emotional exhaustion and that job mobility moderates the relationship between work alienation and emotional exhaustion. We conducted two time-lagged studies in China to test our research model. Studies 1 and 2 found that work alienation was positively related to knowledge hiding and that emotional exhaustion mediated this relationship. Study 2 revealed that job mobility attenuated the positive effect of work alienation on emotional exhaustion and the indirect effects of work alienation on evasive hiding, playing dumb, and rationalized hiding via emotional exhaustion. The present research sheds valuable light on the processes (how) and contingencies (when) whereby work alienation affects knowledge hiding for the first time, thus extending prior research and encouraging further explorations on the topic of work alienation and knowledge hiding.",art

We extend leader-member exchange (LMX) theory by examining subordinate emotional labor directed at leaders as a means of influencing LMX. Specifically, we propose that surface and deep acting have differential effects on supervisor support, which, in turn, influences subordinate perceptions of LMX. We develop a model in which supervisor support mediates the opposing indirect effects of surface and deep acting on LMX. We test this model with data collected in two waves from a sample of 590 employees and find empirical support for our hypotheses. Specifically, a series of hierarchical linear modeling analyses was conducted with Monte Carlo simulation. The test results showed that subordinate surface acting directed at supervisors has a detrimental indirect effect on subordinate perceptions of LMX, whereas deep acting directed at supervisors has the opposite (beneficial) effect. These findings indicate that subordinates can improve their relationships with their supervisors by engaging in deep acting; however, surface acting harms this relationship.",art

An increasing number of workers turn to digital platforms - such as Fiverr, Freelancer, and Upwork - as an alternative to traditional work arrangements. Digital platforms govern how gig workers join, move through, and leave platforms - often with the help of self-learning algorithms. While digital platforms and algorithms take on HRM practices, we know little about how HRM activities unfold on digital work platforms in the gig economy. The study therefore aims to understand how HRM activities apply to and take shape on digital platforms by studying worker perceptions. We combine supervised text analysis with an in-depth qualitative content analysis, relying on 12'924 scraped comments from an online forum of workers on Upwork. We outline five conversations on HRM practices that pertain to access and mobility, training and development, scoring and feedback, appraisal and control and platform literacy and support. Based on these findings, we build five propositions about how digital work platforms employ HRM activities. Our paper contributes to recent work on HRM on digital platforms by (1) developing a new mixed-methods approach that illustrates how the content of HRM practices may differ from traditional organizations, (2) highlighting the changing role of actors in creating HRM practices by introducing the concept of 'crowd-created' HRM practices, and (3) conceptualizing how digital platforms employ a 'hybrid HRM approach'.",art

The impact of work and life conflict on employee performance and turnover is well-understood. In contrast, the role of off-the-job embeddedness - the attachment of an employee to his or her life outside of work - needs clarification in respect to its potential to buffer the negative effects of work and life conflict on employee turnover intention. Drawing on conservation of resources and job embeddedness theories, we argue that off-the-job embeddedness represents a collection of potential social support resources that can assist people in coping with the stressors resulting from work and life conflict. Based on a sample of 341 employees, this paper examines if off-the-job embeddedness moderates the relationship between work and life conflict and employee turnover intention. This study finds that off-the-job embeddedness weakened the impact of work and life conflict on turnover intention for more embedded employees. The implications of these findings are discussed for management practise and for the development of theory related to off-the-job embeddedness.",art

The purpose of this review is to consolidate the stock of empirical research relating to the disclosure or concealment of mental illness in the workplace. We present a comprehensive framework for understanding the challenges that employees and job applicants face surrounding mental illness and identity management. This review aims to synthesize the findings of studies pertaining to the decision to disclose (or not) mental illnesses in the workplace and to channel the findings into a comprehensive model that can serve as a stepping-stone for future research in the field of human resource management (HRM). From the review, we found that organizational support, social support, and individual differences were key antecedents of the decision to disclose. Disclosure also affects outcomes such as access to accommodations and support programs, helping behaviors, psychological wellbeing, and employment success. Practically speaking, this research contributes to the development of a safe and diverse organizational climate in which all employees, regardless of mental illness, feel included in their work environment.",art

With the increasing internationalization of emerging market multinational corporations (EMNCs) especially from the BRICS counties (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South-Africa), the interactions between expatriates from these countries and the 'new' host country nationals (i.e. the U.S. American HCNs) is becoming a common organizational phenomenon. To better understand these interactions, in this study, we used two unique sources of data to examine the impact of HCNs willingness to offer support to expatriates. In Study 1, we used scenario-based experimental design with 571 HCNs from the US and examined their willingness to offer support to expatriates from the BRICS countries. In Study 2, 499 expatriates from the BRICS countries working in the US shared their actual experience with HCNs. Results from the two studies confirmed that expatriate humility was strongly associated with HCNs' willingness to offer social-emotional and instrumental support to expatriates. More specifically, we found that perceived trustworthiness and values similarity acted as the mediating mechanisms. Type of job (financial industry versus educational sector) had no impact on HCNs willingness to offer support, while expatriate country of origin was likely to impact HCN support in the experiment but was shown to have no impact in the actual expatriate experience. We discuss theoretical and practical implications and suggest future research directions.",art

Organizational and human resource management (HRM) scholars have shown an increasing interest in examining how macro-level institutions influence individuals' behaviour, frequently adopting an institutional logics perspective. This approach encourages a holistic perspective, highlighting the multiplicity of logics within organizations. However, HRM studies that adopt an institutional logics approach often focus on just two logics (profession and HRM), downplaying other logics that influence individuals, and not fully assessing how a HRM logic plays out in organizations. Based on 54 interviews with Pakistani banking employees, we find that their perceptions of HRM effectiveness only partially explain their turnover intentions. Several logics (HRM, traditional leadership, corporation, professional, family, and religious logics) and their associated values are in play at work, and help to explain how HRM influences employees' intentions to quit. Consequently, we contend that the HRM literature that applies an institutional logics approach downplays the multiplicity of institutional logics embedded within local contexts, and overlooks how various institutional logics and their constituent values shape individuals' behaviour. Thus, this article highlights the importance of contextualizing HRM policies, ways for HRM research to fully benefit from the institutional logics approach, and the role of values in shaping employees' responses to enacted HRM policies.",art

Wasta, the informal network context omnipresent in the Middle East, is widespread in human resource management (HRM) practices. Yet, its influence on the behaviour of HR managers has not been explored. Utilizing relational gatekeeping theory and the informal network perspective in conjunction with in-depth expert interviews with HR managers, we seek to explore whether and how informal networks (wasta) influence and shape their role in an Arab Middle Eastern context. Our findings indicate that the level of wasta penetration in organizations is reliant on the relational gatekeeping behaviours of HR managers. Furthermore, we show how HR managers compensate for structural deficiencies by leveraging their wasta-derived power to amplify their voices. Nevertheless, the findings also emphasize the significance of power sharing in reducing the expansion of culturally derived power associated with wasta, thereby limiting power dynamics and authority to that derived from the formal organizational hierarchy. These insights advance knowledge on gatekeeping behaviour in the Arab Middle Eastern context and contribute new knowledge regarding the operational modes of informal networks within organizations. Our findings underscore the pivotal role that HR managers play in shaping the organizational culture. From a practical perspective, we offer actionable solutions, such as power sharing through committee work, to enhance the effectiveness of the HR function.",art

The phenomenon of athletic-participation-preference (APP) concerns both scholars and managers, affecting the policy and implementation of fair recruitment. Drawing on the stereotype theories, the current research clarifies the formation and implications of APP in recruitment, along with three unique findings. Firstly, the influence of athletic participation in recruitment is not universal, as recruiters may possess different views. Secondly, the influence of athletic participation in recruitment is not consistent. APP does not boost wage, and the APP is perceived differently between age groups. Finally, team-spirit and goal-orientation are not relevant to APP, as both values exist in both sport and non-sport fields. Research findings have implied that recruiting education and trainings, ethics workshops, and recruiting experiences are crucial to the fair recruitment, alleviating the impact of athletic-participation-preference in recruitment. Suggestions for future studies and fair recruiting practices are also discussed.",art

Despite the bourgeoning interest in talent management (TM) in the last two decades, limited research has been carried out to understand the diffusion of TM strategies and practices from home-country headquarters to their subsidiaries in host countries. Furthermore, extant firm-level research on TM tends to neglect the role of the macro-level context, particularly in emerging economies where talent shortage is acute and their institutional distance is large, with headquarters in developed countries. This study fills these knowledge gaps by exploring the TM of German multinational corporations (MNCs) and their subsidiaries in China. Drawing on qualitative data collected from 42 semi-structured interviews with senior managers, human resource professionals, and operations managers from six German MNCs and their subsidiaries in China, the study uncovers headquarters-subsidiary relations. We identify a portfolio of what we refer to as 'institutional shapers' and develop a model for future research. This study contributes to extant knowledge by contextualizing multi-level TM shapers from an institutional-cultural perspective, supported by cross-country empirical data based on informant triangulation.",art

Firms ask their employees to perform a wide variety of tasks, often with daunting time constraints. Research on the firm-level impact of these behaviors - including work in utility analysis (UA) and star employees - has a long and fruitful history, rich with managerial implications. In this paper I comment on research by Joo et al. (2022), who advanced the literature on UA and star employees by highlighting the effects of variance in workforce performance on important firm-level outcomes among 824,924 employees, pooled across 206 samples. In my view this literature can be substantially enhanced by incorporating important moderating and mediating variables that have been identified in the HR strategy literature. In addition, this work can also be improved by developing a better understanding of the causal processes through which star employees' performance helps to execute strategy, and through the development of better workforce analytics. Advancing this line of research will likely require both qualitative and quantitative research as well as extensive case studies on the identification and implementation of effective workforce strategies.",art

This study uses proactivity and play theories to investigate playful work design - the personal initiative to change the psychological experience of work by redesigning work activities to be more fun and/or more competitive. We postulate that playful work design is positively related to job performance through work engagement. In addition, we hypothesize that this indirect relationship is positively moderated by boredom and negatively moderated by conscientiousness. To test these hypotheses, we conducted a two-wave study among 370 Israeli employees (response = 84%), with one month in-between both measurement waves. Consistent with hypotheses, results of mediation analyses showed that playful work design in the form of designing competition (but not designing fun) was indirectly and positively related to both in-role and extra-role performance, through work engagement. As predicted, the indirect effects of designing fun (but not designing competition) on in-role and extra-role performance were strongest for individuals who reported high (vs. low) levels of boredom. In addition, the indirect relationships of designing competition (but not designing fun) with in-role and extra-role performance through work-engagement were stronger for individuals who reported lower (versus higher) levels of conscientiousness. We discuss how these findings contribute to the theory and practice of playful work design.",art

In this study, we develop and test a framework that theorizes how high-performance work systems (HPWS)-a set of interrelated HR practices-build dynamic capabilities (i.e. learning, integration, and reconfiguration capabilities), which in turn lead to innovation performance. We also hypothesize that organizations with a stronger innovation culture, where employees share a common understanding of the value and importance of innovation, will be better able to convert capabilities into innovation performance. We test our hypotheses using time-lagged, multisource data from 173 companies in the Iranian pharmaceutical industry, a knowledge-intensive, high-velocity environment highly dependent on HRs to innovate. Our results show that the relationship between HPWS and innovation performance is mediated by dynamic capabilities (DCs). Further, alongside finding support for the moderating effect of innovation culture in the relationship between DCs and innovation performance, we find that innovation culture moderates the indirect effect of HPWS on innovation performance via DCs such that innovation culture strengthens the mediated relationship.

We also introduced job control as another boundary condition in the emotional exhaustion-turnover intentions relationship. Three-wave data gathered from 256 emergency rescue workers revealed that participants' surface acting increased their emotional exhaustion which triggered their intention to quit. Task significance was found to moderate the surface acting-emotional exhaustion relationship, such that the interaction effect at medium and high levels drastically reduces the exhaustion level of emergency workers. Individuals with high job control show high turnover intentions in the case of those with medium and high emotional exhaustion. These findings have significant implications for human resource management research and practice, especially around job design for those emergency rescue workers likely serving as emotional laborers.",art

Drawing on Organisational Support Theory (OST) and strategic human resource management (SHRM) literature, we test the role of line managerial support for development (LMSD) and organisational support for development (OSD) as mechanisms through which TM practices influence individual talent performance. Results from a survey based on a talent pool of a Bahraini governmental administrative institution show that LMSD fully mediates the relationship between TM practices and each of the individual talent performance indicators, apart from task performance. We also find that the indirect relationship between TM and individual talent performance was significant at low levels of OSD.

Our identification strategy covers three different methods (i) system GMM, (ii) generalized structural equation model approach, and (iii) propensity score matching approach. The results show that firms' value and performance increase when a woman is in the corporate board or as an executive officer, and the firm has an ECC. Unlike previous literature, we show that ECCs, further than just a monitoring mechanism, support minority groups (women), and this has second-order effects on firms' value and performance.

Research on employee voice has been widely documented for workers in traditional employment relationships (TERs) and has offered a broad understanding of how they express their ideas and complaints at work. However, an under-explored area concerns how workers express voice in non-traditional employment relationships (NTERs) characterised by flexibility, temporality, instability, and insecurity. Studying voice in NTERs is of high importance due to its increased potential proliferation and associated precariousness. In this paper, we expand the knowledge frontiers in the voice literature by conducting an integrative review of empirical studies that explore voice among workers in NTERs. We identify the forms of voice available to non-traditional workers, the issues they are interested in voicing, how effective their voice is in influencing management decisions, determinants, and outcomes of their voice.

We explore the wellbeing of employees (via insomnia and job burnout) due to the importance of a healthy workforce. High Performance Work Systems (HPWS) have been argued as playing a central role, and the present study explores a path model whereby HPWS influences job burnout (emotional exhaustion, cynicism) and then insomnia. Further, work-life balance (WLB) is included as a theoretically derived moderator which might attenuate relationships. These relationships are tested using a sample of 306 employees with time-lagged data, using moderated mediation analysis. The findings show that HPWS is significantly related to all constructs, and while burnout mediates HPWS effects, there remain significant indirect effects. Further, WLB predicts all wellbeing outcomes and interacts with HPWS towards cynicism, and then acts as a boundary condition on the moderated mediation model. Ultimately, we find the indirect effect of HPWS on insomnia (through cynicism) becomes weaker as employee WLB gets stronger. The findings suggest that managing employee wellbeing is a complex process working through various factors, although HPWS appear to play a key role with WLB.

Even where organizational policy provides for flexible work arrangements (FWAs), uptake of FWAs depends on employee perceptions of supervisor and organizational support for flexible work. Supervisor support has previously been identified as having significant influence on employee uptake of FWAs as supervisors can encourage or discourage FWA use. Supervisors work within an organizational context, so understanding how that organizational context shapes supervisor support is critical to improving FWA implementation. Incorporating both signaling theory and HR process theory, this case study of an Australian insurance organization examines the signals of support for FWAs that exist within an organization, and the influence of these signals, both explicit and implicit, on supervisor implementation of FWAs. The findings demonstrate how organizational statements, infrastructure investment, senior manager behavior, and organizational discourse shape supervisor support for FWAs. Theoretically, the study demonstrates that signals are an important feature of a strong HR system and can lead to a discourse of mutual gains which ultimately limits the use of particular FWAs, despite policy ostensibly supporting them. More broadly, the study contributes to a deeper understanding of how the implementation of HR policy can differ from HR policy intent.",art

The study investigates to what extent empowering HRM practices (i.e., workplace flexibility, professional autonomy, and access to knowledge via ICT) and empowering leadership have the potential to motivate employees in displaying workplace proactivity in NWW contexts. The study builds on the empowerment theory to gain a better understanding of how employees are able to make choices in order to achieve the goals set in their work and how leadership can support this. A field study was conducted in four subsidiaries of a large Dutch bank active in the financial sector. In line with expectations, positive relationships were found between professional autonomy, access to knowledge via ICT and empowering leadership, on the one hand, and psychological empowerment, on the other. Also, in line with expectations, a positive relationship was found between psychological empowerment and workplace proactivity. Moreover, as hypothesized, psychological empowerment partly mediated the relationship between the HRM practices and empowering leadership and workplace proactivity. However, autonomy had a direct, negative effect on workplace proactivity. Also workplace flexibility was neither directly nor indirectly associated with workplace proactivity. Finally, HRM and leadership can be viewed as complementary as they combine different perspectives for employees in order to display proactive workplace behaviour. In conclusion, the empowerment process approach helped to disentangle the motivating elements that foster workplace proactivity in modern workplaces.",art

This study draws on person-environment fit and career construction theories to examine the role of job fit, career adaptability, and expatriate type in shaping both objective and subjective career success. Our 2020 sample comprised 191 expatriates who had worked abroad four to five years prior. This group included both self-initiated and assigned expatriates, as well as repatriates and re-expatriates, providing a broader scope than is typical in expatriation studies. The research reveals that job fit, career adaptability, and expatriate type substantially affect career outcomes. It also identifies that the type of expatriate moderates the relationship between career adaptability and objective career success. Our work extends the applicability of person-environment fit theory and career construction theory within the complex landscape of expatriate careers. The investigation not only deepens our understanding of the factors driving career success post-expatriation but also provides valuable insights to aid the effective management of international careers.",art

Foreign exchange students can serve as a valuable talent pool for host-country organizations. This study draws on the ability-motivation-opportunity framework and the intergroup contact theory to examine how foreign exchange students' motivation to study abroad, host-country language ability, and direct and indirect contact opportunities with host-country nationals are related to their willingness to work for host-country organizations. Data were collected from a multi-wave survey of 167 foreign exchange students in Germany. Providing support for our hypotheses, the results suggest that foreign exchange students' motivation to study abroad was positively related to direct contact opportunities (e.g. interacting with locals). Further, exchange students' host-country language ability was positively related to indirect contact opportunities (e.g. visiting cultural sights), which in turn was positively related to their willingness to work for host-country organizations. Opportunities for direct interpersonal contact were not significantly related to willingness to work for host-country organizations. The results also show two-way and three-way interactions among host-country ability, motivation to study abroad, and indirect contact opportunities in predicting exchange students' willingness to work for host-country organizations. Implications for theory, management practice, and policymaking are discussed.",art

Job crafting is a concept of increasing interest to human resource management (HRM), as it involves employees re-designing their jobs to maintain and increase their person-job fit. Job crafting is seen as an individual's self-focused approach to his/her work, and the way other people influence and are influenced by these behaviors is understudied. We built on the relational work design theory and used focus group interviews of 44 employees and thematic analysis method to explore how job crafting is shaped by interactions with others at work. Our results show that relational work characteristics, namely contact with other people and impact on other people, shape the way jobs are crafted. Further, we find that jobs are crafted by mobilizing the relational work design and adapting to it. Based on these findings, we present a typology of four general job crafting strategies. We advance theory on how individuals craft their jobs to consider not just themselves but also others. This study has implications for job crafting theory and HRM by highlighting how the relational properties of work shape the way employees craft their jobs.",art

Solo-living employees are a growing segment of the workforce, yet their work-life experiences are under-researched. Taking a biographical narrative approach, we interviewed 35 solo-livers from different countries to explore their transition to homeworking during the Covid-19 lockdowns. Drawing upon the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model and key concepts from the work-life interface literature, we explored both lost/reduced and new/increased job and personal demands and resources at this time. We found that the transition to homeworking during lockdown created several challenges for solo-living staff, often exacerbated by changes to the demands and resources of others - namely those with childcare responsibilities. We argue that 'sense of entitlement to support for work-life balance' is an important personal resource, which impacts the work-life interface, and which solo-living staff often lack. Our findings offer solo-friendly recommendations for organisational practice.",art

The value of graduate development programmes (GDPs) from a talent management (TM) perspective is unknown. The contemporary TM literature focuses primarily on talent programmes for existing employees whereas less attention has been placed on externally recruited talent pools, in particular graduates. Attracting graduate talent is a priority for many organisations, as evidenced by the amount of investment contributed to this activity, but research on the employer's intended outcomes and expectations of participants in GDPs seems to lack coherence. To bridge this gap, this paper aims to develop a conceptual model to explicate the nature and process of GDP, using TM and the wider career literature. The model helps in our understanding of what contextual factors are important and how these factors influence policy and practice to GDPs. We also explore the value of GDPs based on the psychological contract perspective in a contemporary career system. To achieve these aims, the paper investigates how the design and agenda of GDPs may be reframed by analysing several literatures including talent pool segmentation, identity, psychological contract theory and career management. We also expand the existing TM literature by exploring the factors that directly impact the outcomes of GDPs and set future research agenda.",art

Research on third-party reactions to workplace mistreatment has often focused on a moral perspective, but has devoted limited attention to the role of self-interest. Drawing from a self-interest perspective, we develop a conceptual model that examines how self-interest influences third-party responses to mistreatment within work teams. Several important relational (justice reputation, social status, relationship with the target, power) and situational (number of observers, mistreatment intensity) factors are posited to influence third-party perceptions of team members' expectations for their intervention, and perceptions of the expected salience of their response to their team members. These perceived expectations for intervention are theorized to positively influence the expected salience of their response, which is strengthened under conditions of ethical leadership, ethical climate, and ethical HRM practices. In turn, third parties use a cost-benefit analysis to decide how to respond in a manner that serves their interests, which is moderated by several key factors (probability that intervention alleviates the mistreatment, perceived risk of intervention, third-party vulnerability). We advance a novel process-based conceptual model that provides an alternative lens as to why third parties may intervene during mistreatment within work teams.",art

This study aims to investigate whether career adaptability could enhance an employee's work engagement through job crafting behaviors and to address the role of HR practices in this relationship. Based on career construction theory, we first examine whether career adaptability, as a self-regulatory competency may trigger enhanced job crafting behaviors, which in turn increase employee's work engagement. Second, we propose a moderation model in which different implemented high-performance work practices (HPWPs) moderate the relationship between career adaptability and job crafting. The results show that job crafting mediated the positive relationship between career adaptability and work engagement. The results support the hypothesized moderation only for opportunity-enhancing HPWPs. The relationship between career adaptability and job crafting is positive and significant for medium and high opportunity-enhancing HPWPs, but not for low levels of this HPWPs domain. The results imply that through the implementation of opportunity-enhancing HPWPs organizations can create a room for employees to express their adaptability at work through crafting their jobs, which in turn relates to work engagement.",art

The increasing presence of humanoid robot adoption has generated a change in explorative and exploitative routines. If the explorative routines provoke creativity and critical thinking which are delivered by humans, exploitative routines induce repetitive actions and mimic activities which are executed by humanoids. This has raised the need for a better balance between both routines involving an ambidextrous dynamic process. Here, product innovations play a relevant role in enhancing such balance and labour productivity. If, from the conceptual standpoint, this phenomenon has already been explored, there is still the need to empirically analyse it. We thus offer a meso-analysis of twenty-four countries located in Europe through the lens of the Service Robot Deployment (SRD) Model and the conceptual lens of organizational ambidexterity. By a regression methodology, the results show that humanoid robot adoption is still not affecting labour productivity which, by contrast, is positively and significantly connected with both radically new and marginally modified/unchanged production of innovative routines. Our original contribution, which falls in the field of Human Resources Management and Artificial Intelligence, is that humanoids are not directly impacting labour productivity but indirectly through the generation of both new and marginally modified (or unchanged) routines. This situation persuades senior leaders to achieve a balance between exploitative and explorative product innovation routines.

This article explores how employees with mental illness perceive HRM and its impact, drawing on consumer-centred perspectives. Using the case of consumer-workers employed for their lived experience of mental illness in mental health care services, we investigate the degree to which they feel included or marginalised by HR systems, processes and practices. Through a mixed method study designed along co-production principles, we found consumer-workers faced different but interrelated problems stemming from their status: a general lack of understanding of the role and its purpose; inequity in pay rates, workplace conditions, and training and development; as well as employment precarity and difficulties around disclosure, stigmatisation and discrimination. Overall, organisational support for these unique roles seemed to be lacking despite the clear business need for these positions. We make several contributions: firstly, we show how employees in a unique role that requires experience of mental illness are impacted by the interaction between HR systems, processes and practices; secondly, we illustrate why HR scholars need to engage with varied paradigms of knowledge about mental illness beyond the dominant medical/psychiatric one; and thirdly, we demonstrate a methodology that not only explores employee perspectives, but includes employees in the research design and process.",art

Using an international sample of 2,200 firms during 2000-2016, we show that analyst accuracy decreases significantly when intangible intensity grows. In exploring the determinants of this effect, we distinguish between firm risk and the risk associated with intangibles. Our results reveal the role of financial reporting quality, ownership structure, and institutional quality in moderating the relationship between intangible intensity and analyst accuracy. Analyst forecast accuracy acts as a channel through which the higher levels of information asymmetry associated with intangible intensity affect the cost of equity. Our results are robust to different intangible intensity measures; mandatory changes in financial reporting standards; the implementation of transparency rules in certain industry sectors; and financial crisis periods.

Specifically, based on the agency problems between shareholders and managers and between shareholders and creditors, a research framework is developed to identify the influence of low interest rates on managers' risk-taking incentives proxied by the sensitivity of executive compensation to stock return volatility (Vega). We examine 1,293 firms in the United States between 2000 and 2016, and the results indicate that low interest rates increase the managers' short-term risk-taking incentives and that those incentives contribute to the risk effectively taken by the firm.

New product development (NPD) collaborations with external partners involve high coordination costs and run substantial risks. Formalization seems to be an effective mechanism to mitigate said costs and risks, although the issue of whether formalization actually proves productive or counterproductive remains an open question. This study empirically analyses the direct impact of formalization and the interaction effect between formalization and trust between partners in order to gauge their influence on NPD collaboration performance. Findings indicate that formalization directly boosts the quality and novelty of the new product developed in collaboration, but that it does not affect adherence to schedule. In addition, trust reinforces the productive effect of formalization on new product quality and novelty, and makes the impact of formalization on adherence to schedule positive. However, without trust, we find a null impact of formalization on new product quality and a counterproductive impact on adherence to schedule. These results suggest that formalization and trust may complement each other, reinforcing each other's positive effect on new product quality and novelty and presenting a positive synergistic effect, while helping to overcome the counterproductive effect of formalization on adherence to schedule.JEL CLASSIFICATION: O32",art

The international management literature has presented inconclusive results about the effect of institutional voids in a host country on entrant firms' resource commitment. With the lens of institutional theory and transaction cost theory, this article examines how institutional voids in an emerging market influence a firm's decision to move resources in that market. Resource commitment in an emerging market is examined in terms of the degree of control of the entry strategy employed. The theory presented argues that as institutional voids in a firm's host country escalate, the firm sets out different priority actions to mitigate behavioral and environmental uncertainties in the host country, that in turn affect the degree of control of its entry modes. By relying on a sample of 90 Italian firms operating in China between 2001 and 2010, the results support the hypothesis that the institutional voids-entry mode degree of control relationship displays an inverted U-shape.

Such environments typically have high turnover intentions and neglect behavior. However, safety behavior is paramount for military organizations and neglect behavior can have serious consequences. Social exchanges are often cited as the main reason for these phenomena. We therefore examine turnover intentions and safety compliance behavior of 1,593 airmen from a European NATO Air Force by focusing on different psychological contract (PC) dimensions. We use polynomial regression and response surface analysis. Results show that higher levels of PC fulfillment are related to lower levels of turnover intentions and higher levels of safety compliance behavior. Furthermore, perceptions of PC overfulfillment are negatively associated with turnover intentions, whereas safety compliance is unaffected by positive (overfulfillment) and negative (underfulfillment) PC discrepancies along all PC dimensions. We discuss implications for the PC literature, make suggestions for future research, and provide practical implications.

This stems from SEW preservation being used primarily as an explanatory construct and assessed indirectly rather than directly in empirical studies. To address this research gap, we draw upon organizational control and signaling theories to determine the true interaction between HPWPs and SEW preservation for labor productivity. Specifically, competing hypotheses are presented to determine if this interaction supports complementarity or substitutability. Using a sample of 124 Spanish family firms and a direct measurement of SEW preservation, our results provide support for substitutability, suggesting that family firms can realize higher labor productivity when HPWPs are fully implemented and commitment to SEW preservation is low, and vice versa. These findings have important implications for family firms, given HPWPs' inverse relationship with SEW preservation regarding labor productivity.JEL CLASSIFICATIONJ24, L20, L21, L26, M12_M12, M54_M54, O15",art

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant talent management challenges including (a) hiring freezes and layoffs; (b) salary freezes, canceled bonuses, and pay reductions; (c) how work is done (i.e., teleworking); and (d) increased employee stress and burnout. Also, COVID-19 has made it evident that many organizations do not implement state-of-the-science performance management systems and, instead, have just performance appraisal systems that typically involve a once-a-year evaluation and review, little effort to provide feedback and coaching on an ongoing basis, little alignment between employee performance and the organization's strategic goals, a focus on past performance only, and ownership by the human resources function instead of those rating and being rated. Thus, the lack of value contributed by the usual performance evaluation and review process is the reason why so many organizations are postponing or even completely discontinuing performance evaluations. We argue that when implemented using evidence-based recommendations, performance management (rather than appraisal) serves important administrative, strategic and communication, developmental, organizational maintenance, and documentation purposes and therefore can be particularly useful in addressing contemporary talent management challenges. We offer five recommendations on how to adapt and improve performance management that will help organizations navigate crises like COVID-19 and, just as importantly, allow them to thrive after the crisis is over: (1) measure results in addition to behaviors, (2) measure adaptive performance, (3) conduct stay interviews to retain top performers, (4) implement a multisource performance management system, and (5) collect and use performance promoter scores.JEL CLASSIFICATION: J5 Labor-Management Relations, Trade Unions, and Collective Bargaining; M1 Business Administration; M5 Personnel Economics",art

In this study, we investigate the response intentions of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) during the recent economic crisis initiated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We draw on the cognitive appraisal theory and investigate how an SME's level of proactivity triggers top managers' emotional reactions, which in the end shapes an SME's response strategies (investment vs divestment). To test our assumptions, we use survey data from 155 top managers of Croatian SMEs operating in business-to-business industries. We find that an SME's proactivity positively (negatively) influences the emergence of positive (negative) emotions. Also, we find that top managers charged with positive (negative) emotions are more prone to engage in investment (divestment) as a response to economic crisis. Furthermore, through the broaden-and-build perspective we reveal the mediating effect of emotions on the relationship between proactivity and response intentions as well as the mediating effect of performance expectations on the link between emotions and response intentions.JEL CLASSIFICATION M10; M19",art

This study contributes to the emerging literature on board co-option by examining how and to what extent co-opted directors influence managers' attitudes about earnings management. We find robust evidence that co-option mitigates both real activities and accrual-based earnings management. Our findings support the view that higher co-option reduces managerial short-termism because it enhances managers' job security as co-opted directors are known to be less likely to remove managers from office. Our results are robust to different measures of both co-option and earnings management, and they continue to hold after accounting for endogeneity and selection concerns. Finally, we provide additional evidence showing that a higher degree of co-option lowers the likelihood of the chief executive officer (CEO) being forcefully removed from the office for managing earnings in the previous year.JEL CLASSIFICATION G30; G34; G39",art

Drawing on agency theory, we propose that corporate governance mechanisms play a significant role in determining the value of firms' dynamic capabilities.

This essay focuses on the employer's perspective and considers how firms can use different employment models to improve sustainability during the crisis. We propose two alternative employment models which we label Oversustainability and Mutual Sustainability that depend on the choice of the firm's competitive strategy (proactive/innovative vs analyzer/following).

Multinational enterprises (MNEs) play a fundamental role in advancing the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs), as they enable cities and communities to reach large-scale solutions. In this article, we analyze 348 MNEs' sustainability reports with explicit reference to the SDGs to identify the different roles that MNEs play in advancing the SDGs at the local level. Through qualitative content analysis, the literature on MNEs' roles was validated, extended, and two new roles were found. The five roles of MNEs in local sustainable development that were validated are financer, community capacity builder, product and service provider, partner, and innovator. The three that were extended are employee developer, supply chains and procurement developer, and program deliver, while the two new additions are consultant and awareness raiser.

We conducted a longitudinal analysis of a sample of 868 bankrupt Spanish firms during the period 2004-2017. The empirical results show that stakeholder support and deep cost retrenchment increase the likelihood of survival and performance recovery, while aggressive layoffs are detrimental for turning bankrupt firms around. Surprisingly, intense asset retrenchment had no significant effects on firm survival and also pushed performance downward. The findings suggest that retrenchment should not be regarded as a general remedy for firms suffering the most severe of crisis.

Other authors have observed that firms that grow fast in the early phases of an external crisis are generally more resilient. This countercyclical behavior is less common in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and literature has not delved into the underlying factors that facilitate SMEs' countercyclical strategies. Firm exploration is defined as a firm's willingness to experiment, take risks, be flexible, and accept variation. Our thesis is that exploration acts as a countercyclical factor by slowing down a firm's growth before the external shock takes effect, favoring growth during the crisis, and providing better resilience outcomes.

A survey was conducted involving 212 owners, CEOs, or managing directors of SMEs in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to explore the drivers of firm growth strategies. Our empirical results show that higher environmental uncertainty, in terms of market and regulatory uncertainty, drives SMEs to pursue a more exploratory instead of an exploitative growth strategy. Our results also show that SMEs pursuing more of an exploratory growth strategy focus predominantly on intangible resources such as human capital and social capital while firms pursuing more of an exploitative growth strategy focus more on financial resources. The results from our study provide valuable insights for how managers can structure, bundle, and leverage different resources for developing their strategies based on their level of perceived environmental uncertainty.

It can be defined as a feeling of being connected in an affirmative way to existence. In organizational terms, enchanted workplaces are places of wonder that allow people to be active agents, who can impact on their environment, find meaning in their work, and flourish. In this context, enchantment has been operationalized in organizational and managerial literature in a variety of ways, including being resourceful, happy, resilient, passionate, motivated, or healthy at work, among others. The main purpose of this special issue was to highlight those elements that may promote enchanting work environments, and the processes through which (re-)enchantment may be achieved. Also, we were interested in understanding re-enchantment as an internal process.",art
10.1108/PR-08-2023-0700,"Talent philosophies and institutional factors as determinants of talent management in SMEs: a French country-specific empirical investigation. Purpose - Talent management (TM) is a crucial strategic issue for global organizations, extending beyond multinationals and big companies to encompass small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and contexts outside the Anglo-Saxon sphere. However, TM in SMEs is still under-researched, with a lack of studies and evidence on TM determinants and TM in practice. This study explores, using the lens of institutional theory, how talent philosophies and a combination of institutional factors shape TM in French SMEs, highlighting the interplay between these elements within the specific context of French SMEs. Design/methodology/approach - Given the limited knowledge about TM determinants in SMEs and the need to uncover and understand the phenomenon investigated, this study is exploratory in nature and lends itself to a qualitative research approach. In-depth semi-structured interviews with 27 CEOs, managers, TM and HR managers across 15 SMEs in France provided a comprehensive cross-industry perspective. Findings - The study reveals that talent philosophies in French SMEs are predominantly inclusive and development-oriented, influenced by institutional factors such as the cultural logic of proximity and personalization, state support mechanisms like the Fonds Unique Interministeriel ( FUI) and legal frameworks that emphasize equal opportunity. Organizational elements like size and proximity foster a community-focused, egalitarian TM approach, while ownership and vulnerability lead to a reactive and informal TM strategy. The study presents a model that links these determinants to the specific TM approaches observed in French SMEs, illustrating how institutional factors like centralized control and egalitarianism shape TM practices. Research limitations/implications - This paper highlights the need for more empirical studies on talent philosophies, institutional and organizational factors not only in SMEs but also in comparison with multinational enterprises (MNEs), through institutional theory. Particular attention should be paid to the homogenization of SME sizes based on their level of establishment. Originality/value - This study extends studies on TM determinants in SMEs, from the perspective of talent philosophies, utilizing insights from French institutional theory. It is also among the few and new studies to highlight contextual issues of TM as well as how TM is practiced depending on internal and external factors.",art

10.1108/PR-04-2023-0290,"What is in your résumé? The effects of multiple social categories in résumé screening. PurposeNumerous studies have shown that minority workers are disadvantaged in the labour market due to stereotypes and discrimination. However, published research on resume screening has overlooked the effects of multiple social categorisations pertaining to candidates' gender, education and origin. This study addresses this gap and examines whether the gender, the level of education and the national origin cues mentioned in the resume affect the perceived employability of candidates.Design/methodology/approachThis study employs an experimental between-subjects factorial design in that 12 resumes varying in gender, education and national origin were rated by 373 Portuguese working adults.FindingsThe results documented a gender premium as women were favoured in interpersonal and job skills but not in job suitability, and an education premium, since higher educated candidates were preferred despite their gender and origin. No meaningful interactions for gender x education x national origin were observed, which suggests that ingroup favouritism and outgroup discrimination in resume screening can be averted.Originality/valueThe findings endorse a multidimensional view of perceived employability by investigating candidates' skills and job suitability from the viewpoint of the decision-makers, which extends our understanding of resume-screening discrimination. This is critical to prevent hiring discrimination at an earlier career stage, which can increase youth employment and enhance the integration in the labour market of local minorities such as women, inexperienced workers and second-generation immigrants.",art
10.1108/PR-04-2019-0217,"Transforming self-perceived self-employability and entrepreneurship among mothers through mobile digital sharing economy platforms: an exploratory case study. Purpose This research focuses on the extent sharing economy transforms employability for women impacted by domestic and reproductive work. The authors explore the experience of mothers, of how digital peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms can affect their self-perceived employability and skills deterioration by unlocking human capital through technology acceptance. Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a pragmatism-based approach incorporating using a single-case study research design with the Gioia methodology. It utilised a semi-structured telephone survey to collect data to explore the decisions around usage of a newly developed mobile P2P app, aiming to support employability among mothers. Analysis was conducted inductively using thematic analysis and partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Findings The study finds that mothers experience high rates of continued labour market attachment on a casual or part-time basis, difficulty in juggling family and work, and high levels of concern both about future employment/entrepreneurial opportunities and expected stress in balancing dual roles of carer and earner. While mothers are interested in using new sharing economy technologies to reduce skills deterioration and improve signalling, the authors find that there were both technology and non-technology related barriers. These included trust and security, life-stage mismatch, time poverty and limitation of service offerings. Research limitations/implications This research was limited to mothers in one state in Australia and by the case study research design, the measurement model and the self-report nature of the data collection. Hence, the findings may lack generalisability in other contexts. It also limits the ability to make conclusions regarding causality. Originality/value This exploratory study contributes to research in the intersection between human resources (HR) and entrepreneurship by illustrating how sharing economy platforms can offer women a means to overcome the issues of signalling and skills deterioration in relation to aspects of human capital theory by developing new skills that may act as positive signals signal to potential employers or investors. Additionally, the social interactions between mothers, through technology adoption, can provide a basis for improving future self-employment or entrepreneurship and employability.",art

Purpose As the work context is dynamically changing, enhancing employee engagement through personal and organizational means is still capturing the attention of organizations as well as human resources researchers and practitioners. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine the relationships between self-leadership, employee engagement, and perceived organizational support and to test the moderating effect of perceived organizational support. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through an online self-reporting questionnaire, with a total of 225 employees from Lebanon and 251 employees from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Moderating analysis was conducted using Process v3.3 on both samples. Findings Results have shown that self-leadership and perceived organizational support were positively related to employee engagement in both countries. However, perceived organizational support served to enhance self-leadership and employee engagement in the UAE, but not in Lebanon. Practical implications The findings of this study can be used to help organizations as well as human resources and regional managers operating in the Middle East in giving insights about investing in self-leadership strategies and positively influence employee perception of organizational support to strengthen employee engagement. Originality/value This study is unique in exploring the moderating role of perceived organizational support on the relationship between self-leadership and engagement, and original in theoretically proposing and empirically examining the interaction between perceived organizational support and self-leadership.

Purpose The aim of this study is to explore and unpack the notion of lateral voice within the context of a Chinese hospital. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative design was used, involving interviews of 24 medical personnel from a public hospital in mainland China. This included two focus groups (eight participants each) of physicians and nurses, and eight individual interviews with managers, including a chief nurse and directors of the medical centre. Findings The findings reveal that in top-down contexts with a respect for hierarchy, direct and vertical voice is discouraged but lateral voice fills this gap and can lead in some circumstances to a pathway to collective vertical voice. Interestingly, the study finds that fear of damaging relationships with peers may also discourage lateral voice in some cases, leading to silence altogether. Contradictory lateral voice outcomes arising from employees working within this context are discussed. Originality/value The study makes an original contribution to voice literature through exploring an understudied voice target, that is, voicing to peers. In doing so, the study demonstrates the importance of lateral voice as an important component of voice behaviour.",art

Purpose Drawing upon social influence theory, this study examines employee voice as one potential form of social influence that enables employees to receive positive performance evaluations from their supervisors, further increasing their chances of being promoted to a higher positional level. Importantly, organizational politics as experienced by employees is an important boundary condition that may affect the success of voice in achieving promotability. Design/methodology/approach This study obtained data from 218 independent matched subordinate-supervisor dyads from a manufacturing company in Japan. This study utilized the PROCESS macro developed by Hayes (2013) to test moderated mediation hypotheses. Findings Employee voice positively predicts employee promotability through supervisors' evaluations of employee task performance, and organizational politics operates as a boundary condition at both the first and second stages of moderation. Practical implications By speaking up at work, employees may instill an impression as a highly performing and competent individual in the eyes of their supervisors, thereby increasing their chances of being promoted within their organization. However, it is important to carefully consider the degree of workplace politics before expressing one's voice. For organizations, it is important to ensure that the policies and procedures used to demine promotion decisions are objective. Originality/value This study departs from the traditional perspective that voice is primarily used for prosocial reasons by suggesting that voice can also be used for the purpose of promoting personal career objectives.",art

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the relationship between organizational commitment (OC) and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) as mediated by employee engagement (EE). The impact of different facets of OC (affective, continuance and normative) and EE (alignment, affectiveness and action-orientation) is examined with respect to OCB. Design/methodology/approach Insights from the literature underpin the hypotheses on how EE mediates the relationship between OC and OCB. Primary data using survey questionnaire were collected from 881 permanent employees of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) in India. Hayes' model 4 has been used for the mediation analysis. Findings The analyses show that only one facet of OC- affective commitment and the alignment and action-orientation dimensions of EE positively affect OCB. The relationship between OC and OCB is fully mediated by EE. Practical implications The results imply that engaging employees is pivotal for effectively fostering citizenship behavior among employees. Organizations should be willing to implement strategies and interventions which enhance the emotional experience of employees to foster a sense of belongingness with the organization and engage them. Originality/value The paper draws on a unique data set of a prestigious organization in India to provide insights with substantial degree of generalizability into the relationship between OC, OCB and EE, whilst applying a comprehensive definition of these constructs.

Purpose The purpose of this study is to bring about an exhaustive measurement instrument of employee engagement and validate the same in Indian settings. Design/methodology/approach This descriptive and cross-sectional study initiates with reviewing the available literature in the field of employee engagement to identify factors affecting and the corresponding items defining them. Following the discussion with experts and industry professionals, an instrument was, thus, obtained to administer the primary data from employees working in public and private power companies in India. The study used Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) 3 to demonstrate employee engagement as a first-order reflective and second-order formative construct. Thereafter, reliability and convergent validity were assessed to validate the instrument. Findings This paper conceptualized employee engagement as a multi-factor construct (nine in numbers). The factors are Respect, Supervisor's support and recognition, Growth and development, Creative and challenging job, Job significance, Perceived self-worth, performance evaluation and recognition and Organizational bureaucracy. These factors are exhaustive and collectively define employee engagement. Distortion or omission in any of these items may distort the nature of construct as well. Originality/value Previous studies have defined the concept of employee engagement as unidimensional and thus observe serious lacunas. This study identified employee engagement as a multi-factor construct that incorporates the exhaustive nature of the organizational setting.

Purpose Using the conservation of resource theory, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the potentially positive influence of job stress on creativity through the resource caravan approach. The influence of job stress directly and as a moderator of psychological capital (PsyCap) is explored. Finally, the influence of stress on creativity is investigated as a boundary condition that impacts on the PsyCap-creativity relationship via job satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach Relationships were tested on two samples: (1) an international employee cohort (n = 269) and (2) a New Zealand employee sample (n = 475) and similar effects were found in both studies. Findings PsyCap was found to influence job satisfaction and creativity, with job satisfaction partially mediating this direct effect. Job stress has a positive moderation effect with PsyCap toward creativity, supporting Conservation of Resources theory, which suggests that high PsyCap individuals would have the psychological resources to leverage stress beneficially, making their behaviors more creative. Significant moderated mediation effects indicate complex indirect effects with PsyCap on creativity (via job satisfaction) increasing as job stress gets higher. Practical implications This study calls for researchers' attention toward potentially positive influences of stress when considered in combination with high psychological resources. Practical implications focus manager's and leader's attention toward the enhancement of employees' psychological resources for its stress and creativity related benefits. Originality/value The findings provide new theoretical support for understanding how stress can positively influence creativity. The use of two samples improves confidence in these findings.",art

PurposeUsing signaling theory, the overarching purpose of this study is to provide an insight into how age-inclusive HR practices (AIHRP) influence older workers' voice behavior through job crafting toward strengths (JCS) and how negative age-based metastereotypes (NABM) moderate these relationships.Design/methodology/approachUsing time-lagged data were obtained from 321 Chinese older workers. PROCESS MACRO and Bootstrapping were used to test theoretical hypotheses.FindingsOur results revealed the positive effects of AIHRP on both JCS and voice behavior, and the positive effect of JCS on voice behavior, as well as the mediating role of JCS in the relationship between AIHRP and voice behavior. Besides, results also found that NABM negatively moderate the effect of AIHRP on voice behavior, and the effect of AIHRP on JCS. Additionally, significant moderated mediation effect indicates that the indirect effect of AIHRP on voice via JCS will be weaker for employees with higher NABM.Research limitations/implicationsFirst, we take the lead in linking AIHRP and employees' voice behavior. This complements voice literature by identifying an important new factor in motivating older workers' voice behavior. Second, by exploring the mediating role of JCS, we reveal the black box of how AIHRP affect older workers' voice behavior. Third, this study responds to the call for more studies exploring the boundary conditions of AIHRP and expands the theoretical research framework of the relationship between AIHRP, JCS and voice, deepens our understanding of the mechanism of voice behavior.Practical implicationsOur findings have several practical implications. First, the leadership personnel throughout the firm should be conscious of the crucial role of AIHRP. Second, managers should provide older workers with opportunities to craft their jobs to use their strengths and achieve a better person-job fit, which will result in a series of positive outcomes. Third, organizations should blur intergenerational boundaries within the organization and provide older workers with mentoring opportunities to motivate their voice.Social implicationsOur findings have some social implications. Firstly, the results of this study are beneficial in demonstrating to society that older workers still have significant strengths and value. With reasonable methods, older workers can continue to contribute to the development of organizations and society, which in turn is conducive to changing society's perceived bias toward older workers, reducing age discrimination and promoting social harmony. Secondly, this study provides theoretical guidance for organizations and society to manage older workers, which is conducive to alleviating social problems such as youth labor shortage and increased burden of retirement.Originality/valueThis study is innovative as it first explores the influence, mechanism and boundary conditions of AIHRP on older workers' voice behavior, which not only deepens our understanding of older workers voice, but also enriches the research on AIHRP and JCS.",art

Based on the leader-member exchange (LMX) theory. This study also uses moderated mediation analysis to investigate social networking sites (SNS) use as a moderator to better understand the indirect relationship between transactional leadership and employee GCB.Design/methodology/approachThe data for this quantitative study were collected using a time-lag technique, with two time waves apart by two months. The final sample for the study included 294 employee-supervisor dyads from small and medium-sized tourism enterprises in the north eastern part of China.FindingsFindings supported the study's proposed hypotheses, indicating that transactional leadership has a significant impact on workplace learning and GKM, as well as a significant role of mediators (workplace learning and GKM) in the relationship between transactional leadership and employee GCB. Furthermore, SNS use significantly moderated the impact of both mediators in establishing a link between transactional leadership and employee GCB.Originality/valueThis study offers new perspectives and insights for entrepreneurs, decision-makers, academics and tourism sector experts by identifying and putting into practise the predictive role of transactional leadership in innovative behaviours.

Purpose Nurses' work engagement is critical for the service quality of the hospital. Thus, investigation on the influencing factors of nurses' work engagement has become an important issue. This study addresses this issue by exploring the effect of daily family-to-work conflict (FWC) on next-day work engagement among Chinese nurses. Design/methodology/approach The theoretical model was tested using 555 experience sampling data from 61 nurses collected for 10 workdays in China. Findings Nurses' daily FWC is associated with their next-day ego depletion. Moreover, increased ego depletion ultimately reduces their next-day work engagement. In addition, a between-individual factor of frequency of perceived patient gratitude mitigates the effect of FWC on ego depletion and the indirect effect on work engagement via ego depletion. Originality/value This study is important to the management of health-care organizations as it carries significant implications for theory and practice toward understanding the influence of FWC among nurses. On the one hand, the authors apply the job demands-resources (JD-R) model as the overarching theoretical framework, which contributes to the authors' understanding of how FWC impairs work engagement. On the other hand, the authors extend extant theoretical models of FWC by identifying the frequency of perceived patient gratitude as an important contextual factor that counteracts the negative effects of FWC among nurses. Moreover, organizations could encourage patients to express their gratitude to nurses by providing more channels, such as thank-you notes, to offer nurses some support for overcoming the destructive effect of FWC.",art

Purpose In this paper, the authors argue that multicultural skills and relational leadership act as enablers for open innovation, and thereby examine the process through which teams can utilize multicultural skills to support the development of relational leadership and knowledge sourcing and sharing (KSS) through individual interaction and relationship building. The authors address the following research question: How does relational leadership enable open innovation (OI) among employees with multicultural skills? Design/methodology/approach This paper applies a multi-level approach (team and individual level) and builds on interviews with 20 employees, middle and senior managers with multicultural experiences, working in open innovation environments. Findings The authors' findings shed light on the process through which social exchange relationships among team members (e.g. R&D teams) and knowledge exchange partners are enhanced by the use of multicultural skills and support the development of relational leadership to facilitate KSS and ultimately OI. The decision for participants to collaborate and source and share knowledge is motivated by individual reward (such as establishing network or long-lasting contacts), skill acquisition (such as learning or personal growth in decision-making) and a sense of reciprocity and drive for group gain. The authors encourage greater human resource (HR) manager support for relational leadership and the development and use of multicultural skills to promote KSS. Research limitations/implications Despite the value of our findings, this paper is not without limitations. The authors explained that the focus of this study design was on the work activities of the participants and their skill development and not specific projects or organizations. It was outside the scope of this study to examine variations across organizations and individuals as the authors wanted to focus on multicultural skills and relational leadership as enablers for OI. The authors recommend that future studies extend our research by unpacking how various boundary conditions including relational leadership and multicultural skills impact KSS and OI over the life cycle of innovation teams within large multinational organizations, across countries and ethnicities. Practical implications The study's findings provide managers with improved understandings of how to enable an individual's willingness and readiness to source and share knowledge through multicultural skills and relational leadership. Managers need to ensure that human resource management (HRM) practices celebrate multicultural skills and support relational leadership in innovation teams. The authors suggest managers engaged in OI consider the components of social exchange as described by Meeker (1971) and utilize reciprocity, group gain, rationality and status consistency to support the emergence relational leadership and KSS in innovation teams. Originality/value In this paper, the authors contribute to the dearth of literature on the boundary conditions for OI by examining the role of relational leadership and characteristics/skills of the workforce, namely multicultural skills and contribute to the scarce research on the role of employees with multicultural skills and their impact on OI and present multicultural skills/experiences and relational leadership as enablers for OI.",art

Purpose Research into self-initiated expatriation (SIE) has increased exponentially, although the focus of these investigations has been on professional workers, and little has been gender specific. The purpose of this research therefore is to explore the career and personal motivations for SIE through the novel lens of older women. In this exploratory study, SIE and socio-emotional selectivity motivation theories (SSTs) are used, in addition to the Kaleidoscope Career Model (KCM), to understand the reasons these women have taken this path. Design/methodology/approach The paper employs a qualitative methodology, drawing on in-depth life story interviews with 21 women aged 50 or more who had taken a SIE. A five-step narrative process using a story-telling approach was the method of analysis. Findings The findings show important contradictions to the extant literature. Career dissatisfaction and escape are key motivations for these women. Further, contrary to SST, these women were seeking novelty-new places and new experiences. These women were also seeking authenticity as suggested by KCM, but also challenge was to the fore-not in the career domain, but in the personal domain. Their motivations for SIE extend beyond the current evidence base and understanding of the phenomena. Originality/value The contributions include new insights into the motivational drivers for SIE for these older women and the importance of timing as facilitators of SIE. The SIE nomenclature is broadened through the inclusion of older women and beyond professional spheres.

PurposeMental health issues negatively affect employees' quality of life and employers' bottom line. Consequently, ensuring well-being in the workplace is becoming a high priority from a strategic human resource management perspective. Drawing on basic psychological needs theory, we propose that proactive personality will be related to mental well-being through satisfaction of basic psychological needs. In addition, drawing on the trait-by-trait interactions perspective, we expect the mediated relationship to be moderated by conscientiousness.Design/methodology/approachWe tested our research model using data collected from 185 employees using a three-wave time-lagged design.FindingsProactive personality related to mental well-being indirectly, via psychological need satisfaction, and this indirect relationship was stronger at higher levels of conscientiousness.Practical implicationsEnsuring mental well-being of employees is critical to achieving a competitive advantage. Support for the mediating role of need satisfaction suggests that organizations can tailor interventions aimed at influencing the more malleable mediating variable, psychological need satisfaction, compared to relatively stable personality traits.Originality/valueWe contribute to theory by testing a theoretical explanation for how and why personality affects mental well-being. Another theoretical contribution is demonstrating that mental well-being results from a combination of personality traits, with a trait-by-trait perspective fitting the data better than an unconditional trait model.",art

PurposeWorking mothers experienced dramatic changes to their daily routines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many began to work from home as they simultaneously tried to balance work demands with tending to their children. The purpose of the current study was to examine working mothers' experiences during the pandemic.Design/methodology/approachIn order to examine working mothers' experiences of telework during the pandemic, we conducted a focus group study. 45 working mothers participated, and they answered questions about their experiences.FindingsThree themes emerged from the focus groups: (1) motivation shifts amongst working mothers; (2) difficulty balancing roles as mother and employee; and (3) workplace expectations and support. Many mothers reported that their overall motivation as employees had decreased and that they experienced difficulty in fully attending to their work and their child(ren)'s needs. As mothers navigated the stress of working during the pandemic, they reported varying levels of workplace support and many credited working with other parents as a primary contributor to feeling supported.Originality/valueThe findings from the current study add to the growing body of literature documenting the dark side of teleworking for mothers who struggled immensely with work-life balance. This study builds on past research by allowing mothers to share their experiences in their own words and offering suggestions for how organizations can support mothers in navigating these ongoing challenges as teleworking continues to remain prevalent.

However, recent studies have revealed that there are several potential positive consequences of overqualification. Given this change in perspective on overqualification, we examine how hiring practitioners nowadays look at overqualified job applicants, and what their considerations are for hiring an overqualified job applicant or not.Design/methodology/approachWe have interviewed 33 hiring practitioners to examine their attitudes and considerations toward hiring overqualified job applicants.FindingsResults show that hiring practitioners are aware of potential positive as well as negative consequences of overqualification and consider a variety of factors to assess how beneficial hiring an overqualified candidate will be. These factors fall under three categories: Individual considerations, interpersonal considerations and contextual considerations.Originality/valueWe show that overqualification is not a stigma anymore and that the decision to hire an overqualified job applicant or not depends on a mixture of factors that are carefully considered. Two of these three considerations transcend the individual level (i.e. the overqualified person), whereas most research and theories on the consequences of overqualification do not go beyond the individual level. As such, our findings call for more theory and research on interpersonal and contextual factors shaping the consequences of overqualification.",art

PurposeThis paper aims to propose an expatriate psychological adjustment model that postulates expatriate mental health as an antecedent to psychological adjustment. It presents novel predeparture and post-arrival international human resource management (IHRM) expatriate management mental health supportive interventions.Design/methodology/approachThis paper critically reviews theoretical frameworks in the IHRM domain around expatriate psychological adjustments such as the U-Curve Adjustment Theory (Lysgaard, 1995), the Framework of International Adjustment (Black et al., 1991), the Dimensions of Expatriate Adjustment (Haslberger et al., 2013) and the Stress Outcome Model (Bader and Berg, 2014), in a quest to develop a new conceptual framework. This study presents a new conceptual framework along with propositions to take into consideration the relationship between mental health and expatriates' psychological adjustment.FindingsThe findings suggest that mental health is an antecedent paramount to psychological adjustment. The paper proposes mental health-supportive IHRM expatriate management interventions to address the potential failure of expatriates' psychological adjustment. The authors elaborate on the IHRM expatriate management policies and practices at the home and host country to ensure the mental health of company-assigned expatriates sent on international assignments.Originality/valueThe novel conceptual framework underpins mental health as the antecedent paramount to expatriate adjustment, taking into consid eration the elevated stress of situational events such as COVID-19, which had previously not received substantive formal consideration by research scholars in the IHRM domain. The conceptual framework encourages the inclusion of mental health as an antecedent in future research.",art

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether organizational support for innovation and informational extrinsic rewards moderate the relationship between intrinsic motivation and innovative work behavior. Design/methodology/approach Multiple and hierarchical regression analyses based on data from 150 knowledge workers tested the hypotheses for a South African sample. Findings The results confirmed a positive relationship between intrinsic motivation and innovative work behavior, and found positive relationships between both organizational support for innovation and informational extrinsic rewards and innovative work behavior. While organizational support positively moderated the relationship between intrinsic motivation and innovative work behavior, acting in synergy with intrinsic motivation, informational extrinsic rewards had a negative moderating effect. Practical implications When organizations want to encourage knowledge workers to generate, promote and realize innovative ideas, they should create an environment that encourages autonomy, competence and relatedness, with support for creativity and differences of ideas. Originality/value The study provides new indications of the interactions of synergistic extrinsic rewards and intrinsic motivation to affect innovative work behavior.",art
10.1108/PR-10-2021-0733,"The link between supervisor support, servicing efficacy and job satisfaction among frontline hotel employees: an investigation in Turkey. Purpose This paper aims to examine the association between supervisor support, servicing efficacy and job satisfaction among frontline hotel employees in Turkey. Specifically, the mediating role of servicing efficacy was examined in the link between supervisor support and job satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 421 frontline employees in 4- and 5-star hotels located in the South and South West of Turkey. The authors proposed a conceptual model in which servicing efficacy mediates the link between supervisor support and job satisfaction after controlling for demographic information. Data were analyzed through the structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. Findings Results showed that supervisor support positively predicted servicing efficacy and job satisfaction reports of the employees. Those reporting higher servicing efficacy were more likely to report increased job satisfaction. In addition, servicing efficacy partially mediated the link between supervisor support and job satisfaction. Originality/value The current study provides new evidence on the link between supervisor support, efficacy beliefs and job satisfaction in the hotel industry. This is the first study investigating the mediating role of servicing efficacy in the association between supervisor support and job satisfaction. Moreover, most previous studies separately focusing on supervisor support, efficacy beliefs and job satisfaction in the hospitality industry were conducted in developed, Western countries. In contrast, research examining work-related constructs and outcomes in Turkey's hospitality industry has been limited. Thus, both replicated and original findings would contribute to the generalizability of cumulative knowledge in tourism and hospitality.",art

Purpose Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to be deployed in workplaces. While there are many positive outcomes of AI integration, understanding the extent of its consequences on employees is limited. Hence, this study examines employee perceptions of AI and the consequent influences on employee job attitudes and career behaviors. Utilizing the career self-management perspective, the authors explore the mechanisms related to employee perceptions of AI and potential career exploration behaviors. Design/methodology/approach The authors tested several hypotheses using employee survey data (N = 345 call center agents) collected from a firm that recently integrated AI in their operations. The authors collected data on four occasions (one-week intervals between data collection) to determine employee perceptions of AI taking over jobs (Time 1); job insecurity (Time 2); psychological distress (Time 3); and career exploration behavior (Time 4). Findings The findings reveal that perceptions of AI taking over jobs are significantly associated with higher career exploration behaviors. In addition, the authors found job insecurity and psychological distress as pathways that explain why employees having perceptions of AI taking over their jobs influences their career exploration behaviors. Originality/value These findings fill a gap in the literature by revealing how AI integration in the workplace, despite its many positive outcomes for organizations, can have a negative influence on employees. The negative employee perceptions of AI can lead to career exploration behaviors. From the career self-management perspective, the authors offer novel insights that have practical implications for talent management, particularly the need to communicate effectively to employees about AI integration in the workplace to avoid them feeling threatened and leaving their jobs.",art

Purpose Does perceived managerial intimidation result in harmful emotional and behavioral implications that impair employees' performance? If so, are there buffers against these implications? To answer these questions, the current study relies on the social exchange theory and presents a moderated mediation model in which (1) perceived managerial intimidation evokes hostility that results in both organizational counterproductive work behavior (O-CWB) and interpersonal counterproductive work behavior (I-CWB) and (2) negative affectivity, political skill, tenure with the manager and sectorial affiliation moderate these relationships. Design/methodology/approach The moderated mediation model was tested using a sample of 367 subordinates. The data were collected in three waves. Findings Perceived managerial intimidation was positively related to hostility and both forms of CWB. Moreover, hostility mediated the relationships between perceived managerial intimidation and these two outcomes and sectorial affiliation moderated these mediations. Practical implications Public organizations should implement training programs to develop the awareness of the organizations' managers about the harmful implications of perceived managerial intimidation and teach the managers acceptable methods for improving employees' performance. Originality/value This study investigates whether perceived managerial intimidation results in CWB. The study's findings demonstrate positive relationships between these variables, shedding light on the emotional mediating mechanism that links the variables. Moreover, the study validates sectorial affiliation as a buffer against the negative emotional and behavioral implications of perceived managerial intimidation, providing ideas for practical implications.",art

Purpose Rather than overstating the favorable effects of gamification on work outcomes, the purpose of this paper is to present a more balanced perspective into the effects a gamified human resource management (HRM) system may have on creativity at work. This conceptual paper explores and delineates how employees' interaction with gamification features within a gamified HRM system enables and particularly undermines employees' motivation for workplace creative performance. Design/methodology/approach The cross-disciplinary nature of this paper necessitates the reliance on theoretical principles, the explanatory and predictive capacities of theories central to human-computer interaction, employee motivation and creativity fields. Thus, the tenets of affordance, self-determination and dynamic componential theory were utilized to analyze the affordance of a gamified HRM system for employees' creative outcomes. Findings It is discovered that augmenting the HRM system with gamification affordance is crucial amid global market change and increasing digitization. However, incorporating game design elements into work systems does not necessarily guarantee an increase in creative outcomes. On the contrary, the system may equally undermine employees' motivation, which in turn hampers their creative outcomes. Originality/value Many gamification papers have more often than not touted the positive effects of such a system on the targeted outcome. Based on the affordance theory which shows that a user's interaction with gamification properties could produce different outcomes (not only favorable ones) and considering the intricacies of employees' motivation and behavioral outcomes at work, this paper takes a more balanced perspective to examine how gamification could generate intended as well as unintended consequences for employees' creativity, which is crucial to overall job performance.",art

Purpose Based on the social exchange theory, the paper aims to explore the effects of work-life support (WLS) practices on subjective well-being through work engagement and job satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach Data of 332 bank employees were collected in three waves and analyzed using AMOS and PROCESS macro. Findings The study revealed that WLS practices influenced employees' subjective well-being both directly and indirectly. The study's results further supported the serial mediation of the indirect effect through work engagement and job satisfaction. Practical implications Organizational WLS practices are supposed to play an effective role in helping employees increase subjective well-being. Organizations should attach importance to implementing WLS practices to ensure that employees are engaged and satisfied. Furthermore, organizations should undertake and communicate favorable WLS practices to stimulate employees' work and non-work well-being. Originality/value The study is the first that examines the impact of WLS practices on employees' subjective well-being. Furthermore, the study offers novel insights regarding the dual mediation effect of work engagement and job satisfaction in the relationship between WLS practices and subjective well-being.",art

Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between psychological contracts and subsequent internship outcomes, with a specific focus on employer obligations with regard to career development. The study also examines the potential moderating role of person-organization (P-O) fit. Design/methodology/approach Online surveys were administered to 196 college students both prior to and upon completing their summer internships. Moderated mediation analyses were performed following Hayes (2018). Findings The results show that employer fulfillment of career development is positively associated with organizational attractiveness, as mediated by intern skill acquisition. In addition, high levels of P-O fit ameliorated low developmental situations, with high P-O fit resulting in stronger attraction to the organization than low P-O fit. Practical implications The study underlines the importance of career development and the associated attainment of instrumental resources in the psychological contract process between organizations and interns. For the former, the provision of career development may increase interns' attraction to the organization. For interns, such opportunities can enhance skill acquisition, with differential effects for those with high and low P-O fit. Originality/value This study is the first to provide an empirical assessment of the instrumental outcomes of psychological contract fulfillment with regard to career development prior to formal organizational entry. It further sheds light on the interactive effect of skill acquisition and P-O fit in predicting individual perceptions of the organization.",art

Purpose This paper identifies the stakeholders engaged in inclusive employability management for employees whose health at work is impaired and examines how different mechanisms can be used to engage these stakeholders. The paper aims to explore the link between stakeholder engagement and inclusive employability management. Design/methodology/approach The empirical study uses a qualitative approach to mobilise a case study in a French public organisation. Data collection combines four sources: 50 individual interviews, informal dialogues, 39 days of observations and 43 documents. Findings The findings provide insights into the management of inclusive employability for vulnerable employees and reveal the multiplicity of stakeholders involved. Institutional, organisational and individual mechanisms are used to engage stakeholders in employability management for vulnerable employees. Furthermore, the implementation of inclusive structural and operational mechanisms promotes a policy that favours employability management. However, stakeholders are also faced with institutional, organisational and individual difficulties that limit their engagement. Practical implications The findings have the potential to inform organisational stakeholders - human resources management (HRM) and managerial stakeholders in particular - of the support needed for employability management. The findings emphasise the value of ensuring that employability management policies and practices promote the full integration of vulnerable employees. Originality/value The research fills an important gap in the HRM literature on managing employability for vulnerable employees. In doing so, the study makes a specific contribution to the literature on organisational inclusion with employability management. Our research contributes to extant knowledge of stakeholder engagement by including a bottom-up dimension to facilitate stakeholder engagement.",art

Purpose This article examines the impact of expatriates' interaction adjustment and conducive work environment (i.e. trust, shared vision and intercultural communication) on the development of a common social identity between expatriates and host country nationals (HCNs) using the social identity theory (SIT). It also investigates whether increased trust, shared vision and intercultural communication mediate the relationship between expatriates' interaction adjustment and development of a common social identity. Design/methodology/approach Dyadic data were collected from 93 Chinese expatriates and 239 Pakistani HCNs using a three-wave time-lag design. A multilevel model was estimated using Bayesian estimation technique in the Mplus software. Findings Empirical evidence suggests an inverse relationship between expatriates' interaction adjustment and the development of a common social identity between expatriates and HCNs. Further, trust and intercultural communication led to a positive impact on the group memberships between expatriates and HCNs. However, no support was found regarding the mediating role of trust, shared vision and intercultural communication in this empirical research. Originality/value The existing literature focuses mainly on change experiences of expatriates during international assignments. However, the current study goes beyond this and investigates the individualized change experiences of HCNs. Further, empirical evidence in this research found a negative relationship between expatriates' interaction adjustment and the development of a common social identity between expatriates and HCNs, which needs to be examined further.",art

Purpose The purpose of the article is to examine the experiences of workers with intellectual disability (WWID) and subtle discriminatory practices that hold these workers back from thriving at the workplace. Design/methodology/approach The research design employs the Shore et al. (2011) framework of inclusion supported by optimal distinctiveness theory (ODT) (Brewer, 1991). These theoretical frames are used to examine the potential for WWID to become members of a work group and experience the opportunity to develop their unique selves, negotiate and thrive through their work for purposeful career outcomes. A qualitative case study approach was adopted through interviews and focus groups with a total of 91 participants: 41 WWID, 5 human resource (HR) managers, 5 duty/department managers (DMs), 24 colleagues and 16 supervisors. Findings The authors found that enhancing inclusion is underpinned by the positive impact of human resource management (HRM) practices and line management support for WWID feelings of belongingness and uniqueness that enable them to thrive through their work activities. The authors demonstrate that WWID need manager support and positive social interactions to increase their learning and vitality for work to embrace opportunities for growth. However, when WWID do not have these conditions, there are fewer opportunities for them to thrive at the workplace. Practical implications There is a need for formal HRM and management support and inclusive organisational interventions to mitigate discriminatory practices and better support WWID at work. There is an opportunity for HRM to design training and development around belongingness and uniqueness for this cohort of workers to maximise WWID opportunities to thrive through their work. Originality/value This study examines a cohort of WWID who are often forgotten and subtly discriminated against more so than other minority or vulnerable cohorts in the workplace, especially in terms of their development and reaching their full potential at work, which has an impact on their ability to thrive through their work. The paper makes an innovative contribution to the HRM literature through unpacking the processes through which Shore et al.'s (2011) conceptualisation of belongingness and uniqueness contributes to thriving for a marginalised and often overlooked cohort of workers.",art

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of two positive organizational factors: the perceived supervisor support (PSS) and the self-efficacy (SE) on nurses' burnout (BO), which concurrently affect the turnover intention (TI) and the mediating role of BO in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional survey-based study of a sample of 552 Lebanese registered nurses from 19 Lebanese hospitals was conducted. Findings The authors' findings confirm that PSS and SE both reduce the level of BO and the turnover intention significantly. The higher the perceived supervisors' support and the nurses' SE, the less they experience BO. BO has partially mediated the relationship of the PSS and SE on TI. This study reveals that supervisors' support is well perceived by Lebanese nurses, whose s is relatively high, while their levels of BO are considered moderate. However, BO levels vary proportionally with demographic variables, namely age, work experience, gender, marital status and education. Originality/value This study provides new evidence on the relationship between PSS, SE and BO and turnover intention of Lebanese nurses. It is unique in studying the role of nurses' SE with regard to BO and TI and improving the quality of nurses' work life. It shows the significance of the supervisors' role in supporting the psychological state of nurses. The context of the study, Lebanon, is also novel as it differs from advanced economies institutionally, culturally and in legal frameworks that govern the employee-supervisor relationships.",art

Purpose The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that ethical leadership positively contributes to exploitative learning and explorative learning simultaneously and then examine the moderating role of work centrality in the relationships of ethical leadership with exploitative learning and explorative learning. Design/methodology/approach Time-lagged survey data were collected from 257 middle managers and their 257 immediate supervisors in 76 firms in China. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling and Hayes' PROCESS macro for SPSS. Findings The results revealed that ethical leadership positively contributed to exploitative learning and explorative learning simultaneously. Importantly, the authors found that work centrality strengthened the positive relationships of ethical leadership with both exploitative learning and explorative learning. Practical implications The findings can help organizations enhance exploitative learning and explorative learning simultaneously and enable them to gain a sustainable competitive advantage. Originality/value Although explorative learning and exploitative learning together constitute fundamental resources for organizations' long-term success, prior research has not looked into whether and when leader behaviors facilitate explorative learning and exploitative learning simultaneously. The study contributed to fill this gap by introducing ethical leadership, signifying its positive role in enhancing both explorative learning and exploitative learning, and establishing work centrality as a moderator to reinforce these two positive relationships.",art

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to systematically synthesize the extant literature of knowledge sharing (KS) and knowledge transfer (KT) in the small and medium enterprise (SME) context and to contribute with predictions of emerging themes.Design/methodology/approach - Applied is a systematic literature review using three bibliometric techniques: (1) textual analysis for keywords and abstracts to identify the research hotspots, (2) co-citation analysis of references to identify the evolution of KS and KT in SME and (3) bibliographic coupling analysis of documents to synthesize antecedents and outcomes.Findings - A conceptual map emerges from the review to reveal the antecedents of KS and KT at the individual, group and organizational levels. The analysis shows the strategic importance of KS and KT for the SME context. Specific findings include: (1) KS and KT are involved in enhancing SMEs strategic focus for human resources, including organizational learning, customer relations, creativity, higher profit and positive effects on operational processes and decision-making. (2) Innovation, trust and performance are identified as central human factors linked to KS and KT in SMEs. (3) Human resource (HR) management research could contribute to KS and KT in the SME domain by exploring KS- and KT-based practices, linking the emergence of innovation and innovative behaviors to these practices, leading to a better understanding of strategies that enable the long-term storage and retrieval of tacit and explicit knowledge as organizational memory in the SME context.Originality/value - This paper is one of the first to systematically review KS and KT in SMEs and propose a concept map.

10.1002/hrm.22210,"Does one size fit all? The role of job characteristics in cultivating work passion across knowledge, blue-collar, nonprofit, and managerial work. We integrate the job characteristics and dual work passion models to explore the indirect (via work meaningfulness) effects of job characteristics (i.e., job autonomy, task identity, skill variety, task significance, feedback from the job and feedback from others) on two types of work passion, harmonious passion (HP) and obsessive passion (OP). We first advance occupation-specific predictions for job characteristics-to-work passion relationships and then explore differences in those relationships between HP and OP across four occupational sectors: knowledge work (n = 201), blue-collar work (n = 148), nonprofit work (n = 141), and managerial work (n = 133). Our findings demonstrate that job characteristics are important drivers of work passion. However, our key discovery is that the motivational impact of the job characteristics is not universally applicable but rather depends on the specific occupational context and whether passion is harmonious or obsessive. We therefore conclude that when it comes to translating job characteristics into work passion, the one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate.",art
10.1002/hrm.22201,"Out of the shadow? The effect of high-status employee departure on the performance of staying coworkers in financial brokerage firms. Because high-status employees make disproportional contributions to firms, prior literature suggests that their departure would undermine various organizational outcomes. Building on recent literature, however, we suspect that a high-status employee may have seized disproportional resources and credits from coworkers, thereby restricting them from performing, particularly when the work context is more independent and contested. As a result, the departure of a high-status employee may bring staying coworkers more resources and incentives to perform, causing their performance to improve. To test this possibility, we examine the effect of high-status analysts' departure on the individual performance of analysts who remain, using a sample of sell-side analysts in Chinese financial brokerage firms. Employing a before-and-after treatment research design, we find evidence that after the departure of a high-status analyst, the staying coworkers' individual performance is significantly improved. It is particularly so when they share greater industry overlap with the departing analyst. Our extensional analyses also investigate additional contingencies, which helps provide valuable hints about possible mechanisms.",art
10.1002/hrm.22181,"To stand out or fit in? How perceived overqualification motivates proactive and affiliative performance. Contributing to the literature on positive effects of overqualification, this research examines when and why perceived overqualification predicts affiliative and proactive performance at work. Integrating optimal distinctiveness theory with self-construal theory, we propose that depending on the nature of an employee's self-construal (i.e., independent, or interdependent), perceived overqualification will be associated with two opposing motivational processes-namely, differentiation and assimilation. We expect perceived overqualification to have a positive relationship with a motive for assimilation when an employee has a strong interdependent self-construal. Conversely, we expect perceived overqualification to have a positive relationship with a motive for differentiation when an employee has a strong independent self-construal. We further argue that assimilation-seeking and differentiation-seeking motives will be positively related to affiliative and proactive performance, respectively. We conducted two multi-waved and multisourced studies to test our hypotheses. In a pilot study (N = 249), we first tested our moderation hypothesis. In our main study (N = 496), we tested our overall moderated mediation model. Results from both studies reveal that perceived overqualification can trigger a need for differentiation or assimilation in employees depending on the nature of their self-construal. The differentiation-seeking motive was positively related to proactive performance, while the assimilation-seeking motive was positively related to affiliative performance. Our findings advance overqualification and motivation literatures and provide insights into talent acquisition and management.",art
10.1002/hrm.22156,"Communication quality and relational self-expansion: The path to leadership coaching effectiveness. Leadership coaching-a relational process by which a professional coach works with a leader to support their development-is a common component of learning and development portfolios in organizations. Despite broad agreement about the importance of the coaching relationship, relational processes remain undertheorized, failing to account for the growth and intertwining of coach-leader self-concepts as they engage in a generative and co-creative coaching process. To address these shortcomings, we reconceptualize the relational process within coaching as one of relational self-expansion and theorize that the communication channel and communication quality impact relational self-expansion which, in turn, influences coaching effectiveness. Our hypotheses are tested in a field experiment featuring random assignment to experimental conditions (communication channels) in which a coaching intervention was deployed in five organizations. Using structural equation modeling, we demonstrated that communication quality and relational self-expansion during the coaching process positively predicted coaching effectiveness. Contrary to expectations, communication quality did not differ by channel (phone, videoconference, face-to-face) nor did it predict relational self-expansion.",art

Performance appraisal requires interactions between managers and employees and as such can be highly sensitive to differences in cultural values. This can be challenging when multinational enterprises (MNEs) are active across different institutional contexts, particularly when operating in the culturally complex Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. In this qualitative study, we apply institutional theory to explore how performance appraisal practices are implemented and internalized in MNE subsidiaries in the MENA region through manager-employee interactions. A total of 117 interviews were conducted with different headquarter and subsidiary stakeholders (managers and employees) of four French MNEs operating in Lebanon and Tunisia. The findings indicate that, during implementation, performance appraisal criteria, evaluation, and feedback were adapted based on socio-cultural values to achieve internalization. Such values include the emotional relationship between managers and employees, the fear of losing face, high power distance, the desire to avoid confrontation, and high-context communication. Insights for future research are presented regarding the viability of MNEs operating in the MENA region implementing corporate performance appraisal practices.",art
10.1002/hrm.22254,"Included Yet Socially Anxious: How Disability Severity and Nonacceptance Weaken the Effect of Perceived Climate for Inclusion on Social Anxiety. Understanding the workplace experiences of people with disabilities (PWD) is crucial for creating truly inclusive environments. We explore how perceived climate for inclusion affects social anxiety among employees with varying levels of disability severity. Adopting an interactionist perspective, we propose a mediated moderation model in which disability severity weakens the negative effect of perceived climate for inclusion on social anxiety, with this effect mediated by acceptance of disability. To test our hypotheses, we conducted two studies: one with a sample of Chinese employees and another with a culturally diverse sample. We found that the protective effect of perceived climate for inclusion on reducing social anxiety diminishes as disability severity increases, because individuals with more severe disabilities have lower levels of acceptance of disability. These findings underscore the complexities of fostering workplace inclusion and highlight the critical role of self-acceptance in shaping the effectiveness of inclusive initiatives. Our research contributes to the literature on disability, inclusion, and workplace diversity by revealing the nuanced dynamics that influence social anxiety among PWD in inclusive settings.",art
10.1002/hrm.22244,"Gender promotion gaps across business units in a multiunit organization: Supply- and demand-side drivers. Drawing on gender role and gender queuing theories, we employ a multi-stage process model to investigate demand- and supply-side drivers of gender promotion gaps and to explore variations in these gaps across different business units within an organization. Analyzing 9 years of personnel records from a multiunit European bank, we find that the gender promotion gap is influenced by both supply-side and demand-side factors. Specifically, women are less likely than men to express a motivation to change to a new job or move to a different unit within the bank. Those who do express such motivation are as likely as men to be reassigned to new roles, but their moves are less likely to constitute promotions than are men's moves. Furthermore, gender promotion gaps vary significantly within the organization itself. Business units with the most significant gaps are in regions that have fewer available organizational positions to move into, diminishing women's motivation to seek such moves, and have jobs with numerous incumbents, decreasing women's chances to get a new job or secure a promotion upon doing so. This study extends gender role theory by creating a unified theoretical model that incorporates both employee and employer gender role perceptions as drivers of promotions. It contributes to gender queuing theory by demonstrating the theory's relevance to promotion outcomes.",art
10.1002/hrm.22229,"Motivational strivings, human resource management practices, and job performance: An advancement of the theory of purposeful work behavior. Understanding how employees respond to HR systems is a critical question in the strategic HR literature and the need for more nuanced theoretical frameworks explaining who responds differentially to HR systems persists. Drawing on a contingency perspective and the theory of purposeful work behavior, we present a theoretical framework that suggests that employee motivational goal strivings interact with commensurate HR bundles (communion-enhancing HR bundles, status-enhancing HR bundles, and achievement-enhancing HR bundles) to predict employee job performance. Based on survey data collected from 362 employees in 84 service units, our findings reveal that the effects of communion and status strivings on job performance are more positive and stronger for employees in units with higher levels of communion-enhancing HR bundles and status-enhancing HR bundles, respectively. In contrast, the effect of achievement goal strivings on job performance is weaker in units with higher levels of achievement-enhancing HR bundles.

Moreover, we propose collective occupational calling serves as an alternative motivational source that can substitute for the positive effects of positive affective climate. In analyzing a sample composed of 742 nurses from 48 nursing units of two hospitals in China with data collection at three time points before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, our results supported the substituting effects of unit-level collective occupational calling on positive affective climate stemmed from relationship-oriented HR systems.

10.1002/hrm.22166,"Backlashes or boosts? The role of warmth and gender in relational uncertainty reductions. Both men and women who violate gender stereotypes incur backlashes, or penalties, for these transgressions. However, men who engage in warm, communal behaviors occasionally receive a boost (or benefit) for this female-stereotyped behavior. To understand how and why warmth and gender interact to predict backlashes or boosts, we integrate uncertainty reduction theory with the stereotype content model and examine warmth by gender interactions. In our first study (a field examination of job seekers), we find that men receive a boost in hireability (i.e., an increased likelihood of obtaining a job offer) for exhibiting gender incongruent (i.e., high) levels of warmth, but women do not receive a backlash in hireability for exhibiting gender incongruent (i.e., low) levels of warmth. In our second study (a laboratory experiment), we replicate and extend these findings by elucidating why they occur: warmth reduces relational uncertainty for male, but not female, applicants. In our third study (another laboratory experiment), we again replicate and extend our findings by identifying when these effects are stronger: in male-dominated roles. Our investigation suggests that the valence of the gender stereotype violation matters when it comes to hiring decisions. Indeed, we find that displaying warmth appears to promote, rather than impede, career outcomes for men.",art

This article explores the gaps in strategic human resource management (SHRM) research exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic in order to guide future SHRM research in the context of environmental crises. Using evidence from Danish companies and public organizations collected using a mixed-methods sequential design, we discuss whether existing SHRM frameworks can adequately frame and deliver the academic knowledge needed to address the novel challenges posed by the pandemic. We formulate guidelines for future research that will shape discussions of the role of SHRM in building organizational resilience in the face of environmental crises.",art
10.1002/hrm.22084,"The treatment of disabled individuals in small, medium-sized, and large firms. Integrating literature on small firm informality and organizational growth and development into Stone and Colella's model of the workplace treatment of disabled individuals, we assess prior claims that disability employment outcomes are better in large firms than in small and medium-sized firms. Drawing on the principle of equifinality, we propose disability employment outcomes (workforce disability prevalence and disability gaps in contentment and job satisfaction) will not vary by firm size, given both the formalized approach of large firms (disability equality practices, HR specialists, and union recognition), and the more informal approach of small firms (greater job autonomy, a stronger fairness culture, better work-life balance, and single-site operations with closer personal relationships) may have benefits for disabled people. Analyzing nationally representative matched employer-employee data, we show that, as anticipated, formalized approaches are more prevalent in large firms (and to an extent medium-sized firms) and informal approaches are more prevalent in small firms, and disability employment outcomes do not vary by firm size. However, this appears to reflect the ineffectiveness (rather than effectiveness) of characteristics and practices associated with both large firm formality and small firm informality, with both being weakly associated with better disability employment outcomes.",art
10.1108/PR-02-2024-0159,"Human resource management practices in corporate restructuring: a review and agenda for future research. Purpose - Although corporate restructuring has the potential to provide performance benefits to firms, it can also bring upheaval and challenges to the restructuring firms' employees. Further, the frequency of corporate restructuring across the business landscape shows no signs of abating. The purpose of this review paper is to identify and synthesize what is known about the selection, implementation and outcomes of the human resource management (HRM) practices that firms deploy in the context of corporate restructuring, with the additional aim of distilling fertile research areas for scholars and best-practice guidance for practitioners. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is based upon a systematic review of 110 articles published in highly-ranked, peer-reviewed journals from 2003 to 2023. Findings - This review surfaces the predominant ability-, motivation- and opportunity-enhancing HRM practices employed by restructuring firms. It further elucidates the major themes and challenges associated with the use and outcomes of these practices across firms and restructuring settings. The analysis illuminates gaps and opportunities in the literature to suggest future directions for the study of HRM practices and corporate restructuring. Originality/value - This paper identifies, categorizes and integrates the extant literature on HRM practices and outcomes in corporate restructuring, which is a topic that is salient to both researchers and managers. Papers are classified using the Ability, Motivation and Opportunity framework. An inclusive definition of corporate restructuring, which includes organizational, portfolio, governance and financial restructuring, is applied across two decades of research to provide a comprehensive and holistic assessment.",art

PurposeAged-care work has become an extreme form of work. Anti-violence HRM, comprising practices to combat workplace violence, is important in an industry with widespread violence. In this paper, we employ social exchange theory to better understand the effect of anti-violence HRM and trust in the manager on perceived nurse and PCA cynicism working in Australian aged care facilities and their subsequent intention to leave.Design/methodology/approachThis study used a mixed method with two stages. Stage 1 comprised semi-structured interviews with 10 managers and 50 nurses and PCAs working in Australian aged care facilities. Stage 2 comprised a survey of nurses and PCAs with a total of 254 completed responses in Time 1 (first wave) and 225 completed responses in Time 2 (second wave).FindingsWe tested three hypotheses and reported that interestingly anti-violence HRM was positively associated with organisational cynicism. Organisational cynicism mediated the relationship between anti-violence HRM and intention to leave. Worker trust in the manager moderated the relationship between anti-violence HRM practices and organisational cynicism, such that high levels of trust in the manager increased the effect of anti-violence HRM practices to reduce organisational cynicism and subsequently reduce intention to leave.Originality/valueWe find evidence that in aged care, workers' trust in their managers is critical for effectual anti-violence HRM. We argue that implementation of HRM practices may be more complex in extreme work settings. It is crucial to study HRM in situ and understand the root of social exchange(s) as a foundation for HRM to influence employee attitudes and behaviour.",art

PurposeSaudi Arabia (SA) is amongst the few countries with a significant foreign workforce who are employed in the higher education sector. More specifically, 39% of SA's academic staff members are foreign nationals and 63% of that proportion occupy professorial positions. Drawing from a workforce localisation perspective, the study was framed as an exploration of equity and social justice amongst Saudi nationals and foreign nationals in a university work setting. The authors employ the lens of how human resource development (HRD) opportunities are administered.Design/methodology/approachFollowing the choice of an exploratory qualitative study, the authors employed a multi-case study approach where each of the six universities represented a unit of analysis.FindingsThe authors found that nationality differences influenced access to HRD opportunities. These differences are reinforced by practices associated with procedural processes, managerial discretion and selective restrictions in accessing HRD opportunities.Social implicationsThe findings have both practical and social implications, specifically for the SA government's strategic vision of developing local human capabilities.Originality/valueThe workforce localisation agenda within the higher education sector has both a compounding effect on local human capital and supports SA's 2030 Vision and human capital target. Nonetheless, perceived inequity and injustice in accessing HRD opportunities by foreign nationals potentially undermine morale, academic quality standards and research performance, which impacts the development of future human capital and the 'Saudization' goals.",art
10.1108/PR-05-2023-0424,"Exploring local job seekers perception toward employment in the private and public sectors in Qatar: implications for workforce nationalization policies. Purpose - The influx of expatriates to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries has led to labor imbalance inducing these countries to initiate workforce nationalization policies. However, despite the policies' emphasis on increasing the presence of nationals in all sectors, employing nationals in the private sector is still a critical challenge for policymakers. This paper explores local job seekers' and employees' perceptions of employment choices in the private and public sectors.Design/methodology/approach - Adopting a qualitative approach, data were collected through in-depth interviews with 28 local job seekers, either not currently employed or employed but seeking another job.Findings - The data revealed a contextualized understanding of positive and negative connotations pertaining to employment in the private and public sectors in Qatar.Research limitations/implications - Understanding nationals' negative preconceived notions against working in the private sector and the perceived benefits of public sector employment lays the groundwork for developing measures to help policymakers to create labor market-oriented policies that stimulate mobility between the public and private sectors.Originality/value - This study contributes to the workforce nationalization literature in the GCC countries by examining local job seekers' perceptions associated with employment in the private sector and the public sector. A closer examination of why nationals are hesitant to enter the private sector can propel the pendulum towards higher success rates of workforce nationalization.",art

PurposeNo systematic review has previously been dedicated to comprehensively investigate predictors of well-being and ill-being in working contexts. Empirical studies have vastly associated well-being as the result of autonomous motivation and basic psychological needs satisfaction, while frustration results in ill-being. The purpose of this study is to integrate the variables identified in empirical studies associated with the occurrence of the phenomena, individual/organizational features and consequences associated with workers' well-being/ill-being.Design/methodology/approachThis systematic review includes 44 empirical studies published up to February 2021. Findings are summarized based on quantitative analysis of the evidence.FindingsResults reinforce the role of self-determined motivation and needs satisfaction in promoting well-being, while amotivation and needs frustration led to ill-being. Besides, they indicate that ill-being can both lead to negative consequences and diminish positive work outcomes. Findings also revealed that: integrated motivation does not seem to be empirically distinct from intrinsic and identified motivation in promoting well-being; introjected motivated behaviors may be less harmful to psychological health than externally oriented ones; the relationship between external motivation and well-being/ill-being requires prospective investigations; and amotivation seems to have a detrimental effect in workers' psychological health.Practical implicationsResults provide practical information for HRM practitioners to design work environments and practices that promote employees' psychological health.Originality/valueAn unprecedented framework that aggregates empirical findings regarding the antecedents, predictors and consequences of ill-being/well-being in working contexts is presented.",art
10.1108/PR-05-2020-0358,"Psychological capital and work-home enrichment: job crafting as a mediator. PurposeBased on the Job Demands-Resources theory, this study investigates whether psychological capital (PsyCap) is a precursor of the one-directional work-to-home enrichment (WHE) process through a parallel mediation mechanism enabled by promotion-focused job crafting components.Design/methodology/approachA cross-sectional study was conducted on 231 Romanian employees. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM).FindingsPsyCap (what I can do) is an antecedent of all three promotion-focused job crafting behaviors (what I actually do) and WHE. Two specific job crafting dimensions - increasing social job resources and increasing challenging job demands - fully mediate the link between PsyCap and WHE. Increasing structural job resources does not predict WHE.Originality/valueThis study identifies PsyCap as an antecedent of WHE. It also uncovers underlying behavioral mechanisms that enable the transfer of resources from the work role to individuals' home role by investigating job crafting components as distinct dimensions. As such, it gives practitioners a clearer understanding of which behaviors they should seek to cultivate for employees to potentiate their home role through aspects of their job.",art

Purpose This paper points out that common human resource manageement (HRM) research and practice have overlooked employee's class of origin. Workers' class of origin can be seen as the elephant in the room in current HRM, being that it significantly affects organizational decision-making with negative social (increased class-based inequality) and organizational (inefficient allocation of human re-sources) effects. Design/methodology/approach The paper summarizes the partial, fragmented and multi-disciplinary literature on HRM and employees' social class of origin. Findings The paper shows how recruiting, selection, training and development practices systematically reinforce class-based inequality by providing high-class employees with more resources and opportunities compared to low-class employees. Practical implications The paper provides sustainable HR practitioners, educators and researchers with recommendations on how to address employees' social class of origin, improving organizational competitive advantage and reducing class-based inequality at the societal level. Originality/value The paper focuses on a topic which, in diversity management, is an elephant in the room (i.e. workers social class of origin).",art

PurposeThis research adopts the conservation of resources (COR) theory to examine the effects of trust in organizations and trait mindfulness on optimism and perceived stress of flight attendants in Thailand during the COVID-19 pandemic.Design/methodology/approachOnline survey data were collected from 234 flight attendants who work for five low-cost airlines based in Thailand. The data were analyzed by using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM).FindingsThe results show that trust in an organization and trait mindfulness are negatively associated with the perceived stress of flight attendants. Their associations are also partially mediated by optimism. Moreover, the moderating effect analysis reveals that trait mindfulness intensifies the positive association between trust in organizations and optimism.Originality/valueThe evidence from this research broadens COR theory by showing that different aspects of resources can be combined to strengthen the ability of individuals to gain more resources to lessen stress.",art

Purpose This study unpacks the relationship between employees' perceptions of organizational politics and their helping behavior, by explicating a mediating role of employees' affective commitment and moderating roles of their tenacity and passion for work. Design/methodology/approach Quantitative survey data were collected from 476 employees, through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Findings Beliefs that the organizational climate is predicated on self-serving behaviors diminish helping behaviors, and this effect arises because employees become less emotionally attached to their organization. This mediating role of affective commitment is less salient to the extent that employees persevere in the face of challenges and feel passionate about working hard. Practical implications For human resource managers, this study pinpoints a lack of positive organization-oriented energy as a key mechanism by which perceptions about a negative political climate steer employees away from assisting organizational colleagues on a voluntary basis. They can contain this mechanism by ensuring that employees are equipped with energy-boosting personal resources. Originality/value This study addresses employees' highly salient emotional reactions to organizational politics and pinpoints the critical function of affective commitment for explaining the escalation of perceived organizational politics into diminished helping behavior. It also identifies buffering effects linked to two pertinent personal resources.",art

Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of accelerated job demands on employee outcomes during the COVID-19 crisis. An integrated model was developed to explore the relationships between different types of job demands (learning, decision-making, work intensification), employee turnover intention (TI) and burnout (BU). Design/methodology/approach Data were obtained from professionals whose work conditions were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. An online survey was distributed anonymously. A total of 566 questionnaires were included in the analysis. Structural equation modeling was employed to analyze the data. Findings The findings revealed that employees' perception of job demands impacts the significance and direction of the relationships between different forms of job demands and employee outcomes. Furthermore, the findings confirm that mediating role of perceived organizational support alleviates the adverse effects of job demands on employee outcomes. Finally, the present study supported the moderation effect of positive affectivity between work intensification and employee BU. Practical implications This study provides employers with insights about supporting employees to cope with increased job demands in conditions where rapid changes are inevitable. Originality/value The unique context of research (COVID-19) enabled this study to account for the acceleration of job demands that employees experience in rapidly changing situations. This study employed an instrument that allowed for the assessment of acceleration in job demands. Furthermore, the granular approach of the measurement model extended the perspectives of job demands and work intensification.",art
10.1108/PR-08-2020-0612,"Returnee status, academic staff rewards and psychological contract fulfilment in China's higher education sector. Purpose China's universities have decoupled academic staff rewards and returnee status (scholars with a higher degree or substantial work experience gained outside China). This development possibly poses a threat to returnees' psychological contract fulfilment (PCF), i.e. the extent to which employees perceive their employer has fulfilled their promises or obligations regarding the employment relationship. Drawing on the efficiency-flexibility balance theory, the authors predict Chinese universities would institutionalise human resource management (HRM) practices intended to countervail the decoupling's potentially negative influence. Furthermore, the positive effect of returnee status on PCF would subsequently manifest as higher job satisfaction and lower turnover intention. Design/methodology/approach Utilising a mixed-method approach, the authors first undertook a large-scale multi-time field survey of Chinese business school academics from a group of non-elite universities located in Southern China. The authors then conducted a series of in-depth interviews with a subsample of the surveyed cohort, which was then analysed using multivariate regression analyses and machine-aided qualitative content analysis (i.e. NVivo 10). Findings The authors find that, despite the decoupling of returnee status and faculty rewards, returnee status is positively associated with PCF. This positive association further manifests as an indirect effect on job satisfaction and a negative indirect effect on turnover intention. The authors also determine that returnees experience higher PCF because universities have revised HRM practices to reward evidenced job activities. Returnees can gain a competitive advantage by using their skills gained overseas. Originality/value This study makes four original contributions. First, the authors investigate a neglected yet essential issue, namely, how returnee status relates to PCF in China's universities. Second, the authors enrich the theoretical understanding by introducing the efficiency-flexibility balance theory into the employee PCF literature. Third, the authors provide new insights on how China's universities maximise the effectiveness of academic returnees' talents and skills. Finally, by focusing on non-elite universities, the authors provide insights relevant to a broader faculty population than is available in the existing literature.",art

Purpose This research develops and tests a model for organizational identification (OID) in a sample of knowledge workers in India. It calls attention to the relational antecedents of OID that are often overlooked in existing literature. Strong theoretical arguments are also built for context-specific outcome behaviors such as intrinsic motivation (IM) and innovative work behavior (IWB) that are relevant to knowledge work. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 357 IT industry employees in India. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to test the hypotheses and the path model. Findings Strong support was found for relational antecedents of OID and the outcome variable IWB. The findings indicated that OID impacts IWB through the mediating mechanism of IM. Overall, the model demonstrated strong predictive power. Practical implications The findings suggest that social and relational variables could be strong managerial levers to increase the feeling of belongingness experienced by knowledge workers in India. In turn, OID can impact IWB, which is a significant outcome for knowledge work. Originality/value The study finds strong support for hypothesized relationships that have been unexplored or underexplored in mainstream OID literature. Relational antecedents were found to be strong predictors of OID in this sample. Also, the relationship between OID and IWB, an outcome behavior that is specifically relevant to knowledge-driven businesses, has not been explored earlier.",art

Purpose Using career construction theory, the authors empirically examine the mechanism by which career adaptability promotes employee subjective career success (career satisfaction and career commitment) through job crafting. Design/methodology/approach A moderated mediation model is tested using survey data from 324 full-time business professionals in France. Hypotheses are tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings he authors found that job crafting mediated the relationship between career adaptability and subjective career success (career satisfaction and career commitment). The positive effect of career adaptability on job crafting was greater under higher levels of lone wolf personality and positive perfectionism, as was the indirect effect of career adaptability on subjective career success via job crafting. Research limitations/implications data are cross-sectional in nature. Robust theoretical contentions and affective means of identifying common method variance (CMV) are addressed and evaluated. Practical implications High levels of career adaptability may be a useful strategy for promoting employee job crafting and subjective career success. In addition, individuals with lone wolf personality and positive perfectionism should be given opportunities to craft their jobs in the workplace. Originality/value This research confirms a moderated mediation model positioning job crafting as a mediator of career adaptability's effects on employee subjective career success and lone wolf and positive perfectionism as moderators of such effects. This study suggests that job crafting and career-focused personality traits are important factors that influence the relationship between career adaptability and subjective career success.",art

The authors investigate the effectiveness of high-performance work system (HPWS) intensity as a tool to manage voluntary collective turnover. Further, the authors investigate a cynical workplace climate (CWC) as a boundary condition on the HPWS intensity-voluntary collective turnover relationship. Design/methodology/approach The unit of analysis is the workplace, with human resource (HR) managers providing data on HPWS practices in Time 1 (T1) and voluntary collective turnover two years later. Aggregated employee data were used to assess the cynical workplace climate. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. Findings This study's results demonstrate a negative relationship between HPWS intensity and voluntary collective turnover when there is a low cynical workplace climate. The authors find that in a high cynical workplace climate, HPWS intensity is ineffective at managing voluntary collective turnover. Research limitations/implications This study's results show that HPWS intensity needs to be well received by the workforce to be effective in reducing voluntary collective turnover. Practical implications To increase the chances of HPWS intensity reducing voluntary collective turnover, workplaces need to assess the level of employee cynicism in their workplace climates. When the climate is assessed as low in cynicism, the workplace can then consider implementing an HPWS. Originality/value The authors explain why the HPWS intensity-voluntary collective turnover relationship varies across workplaces. As HR practices are subject to interpretation, workplaces need to look beyond the practices in their HPWS and focus on employee receptivity to HR practices.",art

Findings Perceived PMS accuracy positively influences approach job crafting behaviors through intrinsic motivation and avoidance job crafting behaviors through extrinsic motivation. Practical implications Organizations interested in promoting job crafting should ensure that PMSs are designed and implemented in a way that increases perceived PMS accuracy among employees.

Purpose - This empirical study aims to analyse the talent spotters' perception of their tendency to be homophilic in the talent identification process and their stance on it. Besides, this article examines the type of homophily and the homophily attributes involved.Design/methodology/approach - Based on a qualitative design, 37 middle and senior line managers, working for two Argentine conglomerates in six Latin American countries, participated in the study. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews.Findings - Homophily was perceived by most of talent spotters, who judged it as natural, while it was not perceived by a small group of the interviewees. In addition, among those who recognized its presence, another group advocated the homophilic advantages, while a final one admitted the presence of homophily and its negative implications. In addition, a variety of homophily attributes were identified; most of them within the value category. We posit that if homophily attributes are, at the same time, components of high potential models, homophily will constitute a functional bias to the talent identification process.Originality/value - This is the first study that explores the talent spotters' perception of their homophily bias as well as the diversity of homophily attributes present in the talent identification process. This research highlights the relevance of the homophily attributes' analysis, taking into account its alignment to the potential model in order to improve the talent identification process.",art

10.1002/hrm.22165,"Gender-ethnicity intersectional variation in work-family dynamics: Family interference with work, guilt, and job satisfaction. Although guilt is often considered the most prevalent emotional outcome of work-family conflict (WFC), most work-family research focuses on family-related guilt stemming from work interference with family, rather than job-related guilt stemming from family interference with work (FIW). In addition, there is little understanding of how different employee social groups experience the implications of FIW in their daily lives. To address these research gaps, this study explores the relationship between daily FIW and job-related guilt, and its subsequent impact on job satisfaction. It also investigates variation in these relationships by (1) gender and (2) the intersection of gender and ethnicity. Bayesian multilevel structural equation modeling using data from 5-day diary surveys from 210 solicitors in Britain shows daily FIW is associated with higher job-related guilt and subsequently lower job satisfaction. The relationship is stronger for women than men in general, but is also stronger for South Asian women than white British women (and men), and for South Asian men than white British men. This suggests that studies focusing on single social group characteristics (e.g., gender) are likely to obscure intersectional effects that might produce significant within-group variation. The findings also highlight the importance of integrating workplace inequality arguments into theorization of WFC.",art

Although substantial research has been devoted to describing the challenges people with disabilities face in the workplace, much less attention has been focused on the processes that can bring about change. This article explores a proactive process, representative-negotiated idiosyncratic work arrangements (i-deals), that can create the conditions for long-term employment for people with disabilities. Specifically, we explored the factors associated with the development and success of representative-negotiated i-deals for people with disabilities. Using focus groups and interviews with employers and job developers, we identified nine factors and two prevailing conditions that explain the contexts in which representative-negotiated i-deals will be successful. In doing so, we identified the negotiation stage during which these factors and prevailing conditions influence the i-deals negotiation process. Representative-negotiated i-deals offer insights into how employees with disabilities can find more meaningful work. Together, these findings underscore how the representative i-deals negotiation process is only viable if the facilitating factors are present and supported, while the absence of these factors can hinder and lead to failure.",art
10.1002/hrm.22257,"Work-Related Intimate Partner Violence (WIPV): A Systematic Review and Feminist Conceptual Analysis. Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a long-standing and egregious social issue that inherently impacts and is impacted by work and workplaces. Work-related intimate partner violence (WIPV) is a pattern of IPV that both directly and indirectly undermines victim-survivors' employment, work, and careers, yet scant attention has been paid in management studies to workplace responses and responsibilities regarding this form of violence. Hence, we conduct a systematic review and conceptual analysis of 111 WIPV-focused papers utilizing three well-established feminist lenses to ascertain and conceptualize what we know and do not know about the WIPV domain and, more importantly, to outline an agenda for what we should know from a gendered perspective about WIPV. We develop a gender-sensitive, multilevel framework with which we investigate and challenge the WIPV research agenda from individual, interactionist, and structural viewpoints, including the interaction between these perspectives. A key purpose of this paper is to extend debate about WIPV beyond the current focus of human resource management (HRM) research and practice on micro-level employment issues to include meso-level organizational and macro-level societal issues. A second and connected purpose is to draw attention to the need to address big societal challenges related to workplaces and to highlight the pivotal role of HRM in fostering ethical and socially sustainable workplaces. Thus, we advance the vital debate about WIPV, provide a template for how gender can be conceptualized in HRM and workplace research, and challenge the boundaries for organizational involvement in areas traditionally deemed as private or societal.",art
10.1002/hrm.22250,"Feel the Pressure? Normative Pressures as a Unifying Mechanism for Relational Antecedents of Employee Turnover. Relational perspectives on turnover antecedents have gained momentum in recent years, highlighting three distinct relational forces underlying employees' turnover decisions-notably, job embeddedness, social capital, and turnover contagion. However, these distinct perspectives are typically examined independent of one another, with little theoretical integration or holistic understanding of the shared mechanisms through which these relational antecedents operate on turnover intentions and behavior. We propose a conceptual model integrating the three types of relational antecedents (specifying their unique effects), while positing normative pressures from work and nonwork relationships as a fundamental consideration underlying quit decisions that translates their effects on leaving. Our model tests find support for this common mediator, even when controlling for traditional mediating mechanisms (i.e., job attitudes and perceived alternatives). Our tests also include important cultural considerations, allowing for comparisons between national cultures in our sample of nearly 700 surveyed employees and their subsequent quit intentions and behaviors, spanning the USA, Hong Kong, and China. Our tests revealed that on- and off-the-job embeddedness reduces quit propensity while prospective colleague turnover boosts that propensity. Path analyses further determined that normative pressures predict quit propensity (beyond attitudes and alternatives), and that such pressures mediate how job embeddedness and prospective coworker turnover influence quit propensity. We tease apart these effects across national cultures and discuss theoretical and practical implications of our findings.",art

Negative performance feedback is vital for stimulating employees to enhance their performance despite resulting in stress and adverse work outcomes. Fortunately, artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled automated agents have gradually assumed certain functions led by human leaders, such as providing feedback. Drawing from regulatory focus theory, we propose that AI-based feedback systems can serve as a remediation tool, effectively mitigating employees' apprehensions about receiving negative feedback. In two studies, we found that for employees who fear losing face, AI-based negative feedback motivates promotion-focused cognition-motivation to learn-representing a learning mechanism to promote job performance and impedes their prevention-focused cognition-interpersonal rumination-reducing the depletion needed for job performance. These findings present novel perspectives on using AI in performance feedback.",art
10.1002/hrm.22224,"Managing upward and downward through informal networks in Jordan: The contested terrain of performance management. This study explores how local managers, in practicing Human Resource management (HRM), may pursue their own interests that are out of line with the agendas of headquarters in multinational companies (MNCs). It is widely acknowledged that informal networks have an impact on HRM practices in emerging markets. While these networks are often regarded as beneficial for organizations in compensating for institutional shortfalls, they may also lead to corruption, nepotism, or other ethical transgressions. Indigenous scholarship on informal networks in emerging markets has highlighted how their impact occurs through a dynamic process; powerful placeholders deploy informal networks to entrench existing power and authority relations when managing people. Qualitative data were gathered through 43 in-depth interviews and documentary evidence from MNCs operating in Jordan. MNCs are subject to both home and host country effects; we highlight how, in practicing HRM, country of domicile managers deploy the cultural scripts of wasta informal network to secure and enhance their own relative authority. HRM practices are repurposed by actors who secure and consolidate their power through wasta. They dispense patronage to insiders and marginalize outsiders; the latter includes not only more vulnerable local employees but also expatriates. This phenomenon becomes particularly evident during the performance appraisal process, which may serve as a basis for the differential treatment and rewards of employees. Consequently, this further dilutes the capacity of MNCs to implement-as adverse to espousing-centrally decided approaches to HRM.",art

We sought to investigate the relationship between humans and AI and conducted an in-depth exploratory study into the co-existence of humans and two early-stage AI-solutions, one for low-status automation and another for high-status; augmentation. We suggest that different organizational groups may engage in distinctly different sensemaking processes regarding AI, an important insight for successful HRM strategies when AI is being introduced into the workplace. Moreover, contrary to recent conceptual work, our findings indicate that AI-enabled automation and augmentation solutions may not be detached from nor exist in tension with each other. They are deeply embedded in organizational processes and workflows for which people who co-exist with the technologies must take ownership. Our findings, in part, go against discussions on AI taking over jobs or deskilling humans. We describe a more nuanced version of reality fluctuating around the various ways different organizational groups encounter different AI-solutions in their daily work. Finally, our study warns against unconditional technological enthusiasm, managerial ignorance of the nature of work that employees undertake in different organizational groups, and a neglect of the time and effort required to successfully implement AI-solutions that affect not only the home organization but also members of the broader ecosystem.",art
10.1002/hrm.22129,"Contextualizing social networks: The role of person-organization fit in the network-job performance relationship. While scholars have attended to the performance implications of employee embeddedness in social networks within the workplace, less research accounts for the interface of employee and organizational values in enabling employees to leverage these networks. Network perspectives on employee performance acknowledge that certain informal network positions create resources that are beneficial for performance while simultaneously creating demands that may diminish or erode these benefits. Leveraging a Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) perspective, we suggest that person-organization (PO) fit-the perceived congruence between individual and organizational values-will play a crucial role in shaping the performance effects of demands and resources inherently generated by workplace relationships. Results suggest that PO fit moderates relationships between network positions and individual job performance. Specifically, we find that having many friendships or being heavily sought out for advice enhances performance for those with higher levels of PO fit. Supplemental analyses highlight that incoming friendships or advice ties that are cross-functional are still beneficial for those among the highest in PO fit, but also that these same network positions can be detrimental for employees who are among the lowest in PO fit. These results contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the demands and resources generated by informal networks and how the translation of these features into performance is contingent upon the extent to which an employee identifies with organizational values.",art
10.1002/hrm.22117,"Riding the wave to recovery: Relational energy as an HR managerial resource for employees during crisis recovery. Human resource (HR) managers play a critical role in supporting workers during organizational crisis recovery, but this support is hampered when employee energy is drained during difficult times. We develop relational theory and practical suggestions to address how employees can generate energy from interpersonal interactions in a post-crisis context. Drawing from interviews, field observations, and archival data of interpersonal interactions in the surf and boardsport industry in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis, we investigated individual energetic contributions and the process which generated relational energy, defined as psychological resourcefulness generated from interpersonal interactions that enhances work capacity. Our analysis revealed that in the aftermath of a crisis, employees generated relational energy by engaging in processes of perspective taking and interpersonal adjustment while engaging in crisis-recovery work. This was particularly true when their personal contributions to the interactions were negative or neutral in valence and of low intensity. This is in contrast to assumptions in the literature and industry cultural norms, but was essential to fueling interdependent work efforts during crisis recovery. These findings extend and refine theory on energy at work to help inform HR practice by developing understanding of how the energy generated from other people can be an important resource to help sustain crisis recovery, and how HR managers can support these processes.",art
10.1002/hrm.22109,"Organizational social activities and knowledge management behaviors: An affective events perspective. Research indicates that relationship-oriented HR practices can increase organizational knowledge, yet we know little about the effects of relationship-oriented HR practices on employee knowledge management behaviors. Drawing from affective events theory, we examine the indirect effect of participation in one type of relationship-oriented HR practice (i.e., organizational social activities) on three knowledge management behaviors (i.e., knowledge sharing, knowledge hiding, and knowledge manipulating) via positive affect, as well as the conditional indirect effect of intrinsic motivation for organizational social activities on these relationships. Utilizing a time-separated field study (n = 163), our analysis reveals positive affect fully mediates the relationship between participation in organizational social activities and (a) knowledge sharing and (b) knowledge hiding, and partially mediates the relationship between participation in organizational social activities, and (c) knowledge manipulating. Most interestingly, we unexpectedly found a positive direct effect of participation in organizational social activities on knowledge manipulation, even though the indirect effect via positive affect was negative. The results also indicate that, for individuals with high intrinsic motivation for social activities, there is a significant indirect effect of participation in organizational social activities on all three knowledge management behaviors.",art

10.1002/hrm.22238,"The impact of a compressed workweek on shareholder value: An event study analysis of Belgium's 4-day workweek legislation. While the compressed workweek (CWW) has gained traction in recent years, its impact on firms' financial performance is not well understood. This study addresses this gap in the literature by examining the effect of the CWW on shareholder value. Drawing on social exchange theory and its norm of reciprocity, we introduce a conceptual model on the main effect of the CWW on shareholder value, and the moderating roles of the anticipated type and degree of employee reciprocation. To test the model's predictions, we exploit the announcement of Belgium's mandatory adoption of a CWW in February 2022 as the setting for a policy event study analysis. We find positive average stock price reactions of Belgian listed firms to the CWW's announcement, consistent with investors expecting the CWW to result in favorable employee reciprocation. Stock price reactions are more positive for firms with a lower ex ante employee productivity, suggesting employees are predicted to reciprocate with higher efforts. Stock price reactions are also more positive for firms with a higher reliance on knowledge workers, consistent with these employees deriving a greater utility from flexible working arrangements. Robustness tests, including a placebo analysis and an event study of international firms with Belgian subsidiaries, corroborate our results. Our study offers several theoretical contributions and has practical implications for HR managers and policymakers.",art
10.1002/hrm.22220,"Women's representation in managerial hierarchies: An examination of trickle-down and pipeline effects. The trickle-down effect has been proposed as one means to address women's continued underrepresentation in leadership positions globally. While earlier research supported the trickle-down effect's prediction that increasing women's representation at higher managerial levels will positively impact women's careers at lower managerial levels, recent studies provide inconsistent evidence, leading to claims that it may be spurious. Due to data limitation, most prior trickle-down research has explored just two managerial levels-board and executives-making it difficult to separate a trickle-down effect from external pressures (e.g., shareholders, law) or internal factors (e.g., organizational culture) that may cause it. Furthermore, prior research does not adequately account for women's representation in managerial pipelines, a crucial source of potential managerial talent. To address these concerns, we analyze Australian workplace panel data (2014-2020) that allow for a more robust test of the trickle-down effect than previously examined. Our results support the trickle-down effect across multiple managerial levels below the board level, independent of managerial pipeline effects. The trickle-down and pipeline effects were only observed for positions immediately above and below each managerial level. This highlights the proximity of positions within management hierarchies where the in-group preference and women's direct advocacy for other women are most likely to occur. Our study suggests that simply appointing more women to top positions, such as boards, while beneficial, is not enough to address gender inequality in management meaningfully. We recommend that rather than focusing on gender representation at the top, organizations should set gender diversity goals and monitor progress at all managerial levels. We conclude with implications for theory, practice, and future research.",art
10.1002/hrm.22215,"What are interviews for? A qualitative study of employment interview goals and design. The employment interview is among the most versatile of staffing tools. Yet, the interview is rarely studied as a multipurpose tool. If the interview is used to serve multiple goals, then the interview can be effective (i.e., valid), and effectively designed, in multiple ways. The current study uses qualitative methodology to develop an inductive theory of interview goals and design based on conversational interviews with 29 experienced professional interviewers. Transcript data were analyzed with template analysis grounded in a postpositive epistemology and objectivist ontology. Results suggested that the interview is primarily used to serve three broad goals: performing a targeted assessment, making a positive impression, and informing the applicant. Interviewers reported a variety of strategies for adapting the interview to achieve and balance these goals. In short, findings suggest that the interview is used in multiple ways that have received very little research attention. These findings imply that the concept of interview validity should be expanded to include multiple interviewing goals, and that interview design should be understood as a complex function of these goals. Further implications for the research, theory, and practice of employment interviews are discussed.",art

A review of the pay dispersion literature indicates a controversy around this vital question and suggests that numerous contingency factors moderate the effects of pay dispersion. In an empirical study of four Finnish companies consisting of 141 work units, we examine contingencies in attitudinal reactions to job-based pay dispersion among blue-collar workers. Based on archival pay data matched with employee survey responses (n = 536), we find that perceptions of pay basis legitimacy, task interdependence, and an individual's pay standing within the work unit explain the strength and direction of the relation between job-based pay dispersion and employee attitudes (i.e., work engagement and organizational commitment). Our findings have implications for the design of pay systems and contribute to a better appreciation of the complexities underlying employee attitudinal responses to pay dispersion.",art
10.1002/hrm.22145,"Does human resource system strength help employees act proactively? The roles of crisis strength and work engagement. Many empirical studies have elucidated the antecedents and psychological mechanisms of employees' proactive behaviors. However, there is limited knowledge about how a human resource (HR) system helps employees proactively adjust to their changing work environment. Drawing on social exchange theory and event system theory, we developed a theoretical model to examine whether, how, and when perceptions of the HR system strength impact employee proactive behavior during crises. Results from a three-wave time-lagged survey of 305 employees in 65 teams in eight Chinese companies indicate that HR system strength creates a strong situation by alleviating employees' uncertainty about how to behave during crises, which stimulates employees' work engagement and subsequent proactive behaviors. Moreover, employees' perceptions of HR system strength are more likely to influence work engagement when employees perceive the COVID-19 crisis as more severe. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the findings and outline important future research directions.",art
10.1002/hrm.22142,"High performance work systems and perceived organizational support: The contribution of human resource department's organizational embodiment. Integrating the literatures on strategic human resource management and organizational support theory, we examine the cross-level relationship between high performance work systems (HPWS) at the team-level and individual perceptions of organizational support (i.e., POS). In addition, we introduce a critical boundary condition, the HR department's organizational embodiment (HROE), which involves the extent to which employees identify the HR department with the organization. We propose that the cross-level HPWS-POS relationship is moderated by HROE, such that the linkage between HPWS and POS is stronger when HROE is high. With a sample of 103 teams and 399 employees in South Korea, we find that HPWS utilization increases POS and that this relationship is stronger when HROE is high. We also find that HR department status and the favorable attitude of the HR head are antecedents to HROE. These findings suggest that HROE is a critical boundary condition for the relationship between HPWS and POS with subsequent effects on organizational commitment and job satisfaction.",art

These predictions hinge on healthcare workers' difficulty in maintaining display rules. We conducted a lagged experience sampling methodology (ESM) survey of 621 complete daily observations from 93 healthcare workers who work in direct contact with patients at a large public hospital in China across consecutive 10 working days.FindingsResults of multilevel path analysis demonstrate that daily leader humor behaviors are positively related to healthcare workers' same-day positive affect, and this positive affect enhances their next-day helping behaviors towards patients. Furthermore, healthcare workers' higher difficulty in maintaining display rules attenuates the benefits of daily leader humor behaviors.Originality/valueBuilding on the COR theory and adopting a diary research design, this study shows daily fluctuations in leader humor behaviors and proposes a mechanism through which daily leader humor behaviors indirectly affect healthcare workers' next-day helping behaviors.

The issue reviews the concept of VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity), highlights its implications for the learning and development function and argues that learning and development play a critical role in helping organisations, people and the societal context in which they operate to work within and navigate VUCA contexts. Design/methodology/approach - The contributions to this special issue propose a novel learning and development framework that will inform L&D as the provision of training, learning and development activities in organisations within highly dynamic VUCA contexts and ensuring a strong external focus including organisational, people, community, economic and societal sustainability. Findings - We, the authors, propose seven features of a strategic sustainability L&D function and L&D professional role that are a fit with highly dynamic VUCA contexts. Practical implications - The proposed framework has important implications for the way in which L&D is structured, its key priorities and plans and the competencies of L&D professionals to add value to all stakeholders. We also emphasise that the work on the L&D function in highly dynamic VUCA contexts needs to be broader and move beyond a performance orientation.

Measures were selected based on their predominance and use in the learning agility literature and organizational settings.FindingsLearning agility measurement is an area requiring further research. Multiple conceptualizations of learning agility exist, making the true structure of learning agility unclear. The learning agility measures in the academic literature deviate from learning agility's traditional conceptualization and require further validation and convergent validity studies.

Purpose This research investigates how the Covid-19 pandemic initially affected organisational managers, as seen from their executive coaches' perspective by asking: (1) What challenges did managers experience during the initial stages of the Covid-19 pandemic? and (2) How did coaching foster crisis management skills during this time? Executive coaches are in a unique, confidential and professionally intimate position to observe their clients' thoughts, emotions and behaviours. Design/methodology/approach Using an interpretivist approach, interviews conducted with 26 executive coaches from the USA, UK, Australia and South Africa during the initial stages of the pandemic (first three weeks of April 2020) were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings Coaches observed how the Covid-19 pandemic caused managers to experience a tension between managing their staff, their own bosses and themselves. Ranging from logistical challenges to personal fear, uncertainty and loss of identity, managers confided in and relied on their coaches to help them to reflect, provide support, but also challenge them to take a forward-looking stance. Findings were interpreted through the lenses of crisis management and coaching efficacy theory. Crisis management theory is extended by suggesting that greater priority must be given to managers' personal well-being and by adding coaching as a new intervention to develop crisis management skills. Coaching theory is extended by showing that executive coaching can foster certain crisis management skills and that the benefits of coaching in non-crisis times are also relevant during a crisis. Practical implications Managers, their leaders, executive coaches and purchasers of coaching services, such as human resource practitioners, should take note of the challenges managers face during crises. They should consider executive coaching as a support intervention to foster requisite crisis management skills. Originality/value The findings provide novel, empirical evidence suggesting that executive coaching could foster crisis management skills. The unique Covid-19 context provides rare insights into managerial thinking, emotions and behaviour during extreme crisis situations, contributing to the design of appropriate support interventions.",art

PurposeOur core aim was to explore the perceptions of precarious workers on the ways in which the pandemic impacted their relationships with their employing organizations and to explore the ways in which they viewed the pandemic as (re)shaping the dynamics of precarious work and the extent to which they saw the pandemic as contributing to substantive improvement in their working lives or whether the pandemic is exacerbating their marginalisation.Design/methodology/approachWe adopted an approach akin to grounded theory in an exploratory research design and utilized in-depth, semi-structured interviews as the most apposite method of data collection. Our research design centred on a two-phase data collection approach, which were intended to gather data at two points. First, during the most difficult part of the pandemic, which we describe as the Lockdown phase and second, during the period wherein the pandemic rules were eased but elements of the risks remained; the New Normal phase.FindingsThis article reports the findings of a longitudinal study of the reflections and interpretations of precarious workers on the impacts of the pandemic on their relationships with their employing organizations. We supply findings across three periods - pre-the COVID-19 pandemic, during the pandemic lockdown phase and post-lockdowns in the new normal phase.Research limitations/implicationsThe first contribution of the study is the importance of voice and giving voice to workers in nontraditional, fragmented and marginalised employment. Our study builds on these contributions by exploring the journeys of precarious workers and is particularly valuable in that we explore the perceptions of these workers across the societal, organizational and employment/working turbulence of the pandemic. The second contribution arises from the insights developed through studying the working lives and experiences of precarious workers longitudinally rather than in a single, snapshot fashion. A third contribution centres on how precarious workers felt they were treated by others during both the two phases of the study. The insights here are complex and, in parts, contradictory - reflecting the interpretations and conflicted opinions/deeds of those connected with precarious workers.Originality/valueIt is particularly important for scholars to understand the ways in which the pandemic shaped (or reshaped) the dynamics of precarious work and to understand whether the evolving conceptions of the centrality of such workers as essential during the pandemic (Crane and Matten, 2021) contributed to substantive or merely illusory, improvements in their working lives.

PurposeEmployee recognition systems are ubiquitous in organizations (WorldatWork, 2019) and have positive effects on work outcomes (e.g. Stajkovic and Luthans, 2001). However, psychologically meaningful recognition relies on the recognition giver being motivated to observe and recognize coworkers. Crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic may impact recognition giving in varying ways, yet little research considers this possibility.Design/methodology/approachThis longitudinal field study examined the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on recognition and acknowledgment giving among frontline and nonfrontline healthcare workers at daily and aggregated levels. We tested the relationships between publicly available daily indicators of COVID-19 and objectively measured daily recognition and acknowledgment giving within a web-based platform.FindingsWe found that the amount of daily recognition giving was no different during the crisis compared to the year before, but fewer employees gave recognition, and significantly more recognition was given on days when COVID-19 indicators were relatively high. In contrast, the amount of acknowledgment giving was significantly lower in frontline staff and significantly higher in nonfrontline staff during the pandemic than before, but on a daily-level, acknowledgment was unrelated to COVID-19 indicators.Practical implicationsOur results suggest that organizational crises may at once inhibit and stimulate employee recognition and acknowledgment.Originality/valueOur research is the first to empirically demonstrate that situational factors associated with a crisis can impact recognition giving behavior, and they do so in ways consistent with ostensibly contradictory theories.",art

PurposeThis study explored the challenges academics faced with work structures during the COVID-19 pandemic and their implications for their work-life balance (WLB).Design/methodology/approachRelying on the interpretative paradigm and the qualitative research method, the dataset consists of semi-structured interviews with 43 academics in the United Kingdom.FindingsThis study's findings indicate that academics in the UK experience issues around increased boundary permeability between work and nonwork domains and role overlap, which engender the transfer of negative rather than positive spillover experiences and exacerbate negative consequences to the well-being of academics. ICTs also reinforced gendered work-family boundaries and generated more negative work-life/family spillover for women than for men.Practical implicationsHigher Education Institutions (HEIs) need to address ICT-related health issues through better work designs and HR initiatives that respond to the health requirements of academics. Policymakers should be futuristic and ensure comprehensive work-life policies for academics, which are necessary for humanising overall organisational well-being.Originality/valueAlthough COVID-19 challenges are common to all workers, the experiences and effects on specific workers (in this case, UK academics) within specific national jurisdictions play out differentially, and they are often experienced with different levels of depth and intensity.",art
10.1108/PR-06-2022-0453,"The yin and yang of employee voice: an exploratory study. PurposeThis study examines the yin (promotive) and yang (prohibitive) of employee voice based on employee preference for voice channel attributes. Employee inputs may be disregarded, requiring employees to maneuver for unheeded voice and adopt alternate voice tactics. The authors emphasize the ubiquity of lurking employee silence and its affective effects on subsequent cycles of voice or silence.Design/methodology/approachQualitative design involving semi-structured interviews of employees from service sector firms in India assisted the inquiry.FindingsEmployees prefer voice channel attributes that ensure visibility and data substance for promotive voice and anonymity and confidentiality for prohibitive voice. Voice target switching and message reframing were common employee strategies. Silence on both sharing views/opinions (promotive) and voicing issues/concerns (prohibitive) weakens employee future voice incidents, besides suppressing the affect. Post-silence cognitive reappraisal increases voice incidences.Research limitations/implicationsFindings may have limited generalizability given the qualitative design of the study. Moving beyond extant episodic voice research, the authors demonstrate the recurrent nature of employee voice and silence. The study broadens perspectives on how varied voice types necessitate nuanced voice channel attributes.Originality/valuePresent work brings together organizational behavior (OB) perspective on discretionary voice through human resource (HR)-based channels, helping bridge the gap between previously disparate stands.",art
10.1108/PR-01-2022-0030,"Imposter phenomenon and employee mental health: what role do organizations play?. PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to explore impostor syndrome or impostor phenomenon (IP), which is defined as high-achieving individuals' failure to internalize accomplishments. Despite the wide study of IP, the role of the context beyond the individual is largely ignored, although recently, calls have been made for such scrutiny. In this study perceived organizational support (POS) is included as a contextual factor.Design/methodology/approachUsing a large and representative sample (n = 1,042) of New Zealand employees, the study seeks to investigate IP using the standard Clance IP scale test, and the frequency of IP is calculated. Next, it assesses the links between IP and mental health, specifically job anxiety and job depression, are explored. POS is included as a moderator.FindingsOverall, the study finds solid evidence of the psychometric properties of the scale, with the following frequencies across categories: few IP issues (14.0%), moderate IP issues (37.3%), frequent IP issues (39.7%) and intense IP issues (8.9%). Regression analysis shows that IP is positively related to job anxiety and job depression. The interactions between POS and IP support the hypothesized buffering effect. Additional tests suggest that IP is a widespread workplace phenomenon irrespective of individual or organization demographics.Research limitations/implicationsThe findings of this study highlight the common nature of IP in the workplace and its role in mental health. However, POS clearly can play a key role in its management in the workplace.Originality/valueThe IP literature has a limited focus on workplaces, and mental health, including POS as a moderator, and provides additional value.",art

Purpose Drawing on the social exchange theory, the authors extend the high-reliability literature by examining employees' subjective experience of working in contexts engaging in mindful organizing (MO). Ultimately, they ask the question about how MO affects employees' attitudes and behavior toward work and organization, such us organizational commitment (OC), motivation to work and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), in ordinary business settings. The purpose of this paper is to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach The authors surveyed 307 employees from various industries, using paper-and-pencil questionnaires. A series of hierarchical regression analyses and structural equation modeling were performed to test our hypotheses. Findings The authors found that MO is positively related to employees' affective and normative commitment to an organization, and that affective commitment is positively related to motivation to work and OCB. The study also reveals that the affective commitment has a partially mediating role in the MO - motivation and MO - OCB relations. Although several researchers argue that the effectiveness of MO may be higher in an uncertain environment, the authors' study indicates that the environment does not moderate the relationship between MO and OC. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is one of the first attempts to explore the effects of MO in a traditional (i.e. nonhigh reliability) business context. Furthermore, their findings prove that MO not only leads to higher reliability and greater safety, as previous studies show, but it also positively affects performance-related attitudes and behavior.",art

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to shed more light on the relative impact of the various workplace resources on employees' effective coping with job stress symptoms, taking into account synergistic and antagonistic effects. The authors used job demands-resources (JD-R) theory as an overarching theoretical framework to test the hypotheses. Design/methodology/approach The authors used a factorial survey experiment and a within-person design. Data were obtained from a random sample of 97 Greek employees working in public and private organizations. Multilevel modeling regression techniques were used for data analyses. The authors examined the relative effect of various job resources at different levels on employees' ratings of effective coping with job stress symptoms. In parallel, the authors investigated the possible synergistic and antagonistic interactions between the specific job resources. Findings The authors found that managers' leadership and humor style, their relationship with subordinates and coworkers' support had positive effects on employees' coping with job stress. In addition, the authors found that the manager's leadership style interacts with manager-subordinate relationship quality and coworkers' support as well as the latter interacts with the manager's humor style and manager-subordinate relationship quality. The study model explained 50% of the variance in effective coping with stress ratings. Originality/value The study highlights the importance of workplace resources as contextual variables, for the effective coping with stress symptoms at work. It highlights that a combination of workplace resources produces a net effect that was better than would have been expected based solely on the individual performance of these job resources. As such, the research answer calls to attend to the effects of synergistic effects of workplace resources on effective coping with stress symptoms at work.",art

Purpose This study asks whether lower quality forms of employment lead to career transitions into higher quality forms of employment acting as steppingstones, or bridges or, whether instead they lead to dead-ends, or traps, in which workers move between unstable jobs with low prospects for upward mobility and unemployment. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a unique longitudinal dataset recording monthly employment states over 3 years for 373 individuals in the Albanian city of Shkoder. The analysis uses sequence and regression analysis to investigate whether people employed in lower quality, more precarious jobs remain in these kinds of jobs or instead are able to transition into higher quality, permanent and full-time employment. Findings In line with previous evidence for the region, the analysis confirms the precarization of many working lives particularly for women, young people and those with lower educational attainment. This evidence is more supportive of the dead-end hypothesis than the idea that a lower quality job can be a steppingstone into a better job. Originality/value This study contributes to the limited knowledge of labour market functioning in developing post-socialist Western Balkans countries. Recent flexicurity policies have generated an increased prevalence of more precarious employment arrangements in Albania. This investigation addresses previous research limitations regarding point-in-time transitions and unobserved heterogeneity using retrospective longitudinal data and controlling for personality traits.",art

Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine whether servant leadership (SL) buffers the negative relationship between perceived organizational politics (POP) and employee performance outcomes. Design/methodology/approach Time-lagged multi source data were collected from 236 supervisor-subordinate dyads in a public sector university in Pakistan. SL, POP and several control variables were measured in subordinates at time 1, and supervisor ratings of organization citizenship behaviors and task performance were measured at time 2. The authors performed moderated multiple regression analysis to test the hypotheses underpinning the study. Findings Findings revealed that POP was negatively related to employee task performance and two types of organization citizenship behavior (individual and organizational). Findings also revealed that SL attenuated the negative effect of POP on employee task performance and the two types of organization citizenship behavior. Practical implications SL is particularly important in organizational cultures characterized by high politics; therefore, managers seeking to enhance task performance and citizenship behavior in employees should adopt this style of leadership if possible. Originality/value This is the first study conducted in the South Asian context that has examined whether, and how, SL buffers the negative effects of POP on employee task performance and organization citizenship behavior.",art

However, its impact on newcomers' well-being has been rarely investigated. In this paper, based on affective events theory and the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, the authors proposed a moderated mediation model to explore the effect of humble leadership on newcomer well-being. In the model, we identified newcomers' pride as a mediating variable and newcomers' proactive personality as a moderating variable. Design/methodology/approach The data were from a two-wave sample containing 213 newcomers. The hypothesized model was tested using partial least squares structural equational modeling. Findings The results demonstrated that humble leadership was positively related to newcomers' well-being, and newcomers' pride medicated this relationship. Additionally, newcomers' proactive personality moderated the relationship between humble leadership and newcomers' pride. Research limitations/implications The authors adopted a cross-sectional research design, rendering it difficult to derive causal relationships between variables. In addition, all data were from self-reports of newcomers which would suffer from common method variance.

Purpose Despite workplace cheating behavior is common and costly, little research has explored its antecedents from customers' perspective. The current study aims to investigate the indirect mechanisms between customer mistreatment and cheating behavior, and exam the moderated role of traditionality. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on conservation of resources theory, the authors examine how customer mistreatment affects workplace cheating behavior. They test their hypotheses using a time-lagged field study of 183 employees. Findings The results show that customer mistreatment is positively related to interpersonal conflict with customers, which positively affects workplace cheating behavior. Traditionality moderates the indirect effect of customer mistreatment on workplace cheating behavior. Originality/value This study calls for researchers' attention to exploring the antecedents of workplace cheating behavior from customers' perspective, and first provides empirical evidence on the relationship between customer mistreatment and workplace cheating behavior, which has never been examined.",art

Purpose This research examines the extent to which emotional contagions are shaped by human resource practices (HRPs) and work harassment and the influence of this on employee well-being and innovative behaviour. Design/methodology/approach The authors examined a structural equation model, including two waves of survey data from 240 healthcare professionals to explore the statistical associations between the tested variables. Findings The results do not show support for a significant relationship linking HRPs with work harassment. However, a significant positive effect linking HRPs, positive contagion, well-being and innovative behaviour was noted, in addition to a significant negative link from harassment on positive contagion, well-being and innovation behaviour. Originality/value The research highlights the limited role that HRPs (alone) play in mitigating harassment and their deleterious effects.

Purpose The number of self-initiated expatriates (SIEs) is growing, yet we know relatively little about their work experiences, especially how they react to stress. The purpose of this study is to examine whether challenge and hindrance stressors influence SIEs' intent to remain as well as the possible influence of emotional resilience and cultural novelty upon these relationships. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 249 SIEs working in China. Findings As hypothesized, hindrance stressors were negatively related to the SIEs' intent to remain. Contrary to expectations, challenge stressors were not associated with intent to remain. Hindrance (challenge) stressors were negatively (positively) related to emotional resilience, and resilience mediated the relationship between stressors and intent to remain. Cultural novelty failed to moderate the relationship between emotional resilience and intent to remain and did not moderate the mediated effects of challenge stressors on intent to remain via emotional resilience. Cultural novelty did moderate the mediated effects of hindrance stressors on intent to remain via emotional resilience, but not in the hypothesized direction. Research limitations/implications This study was cross-sectional. It examined SIEs working in China, and its findings may not be generalizable to SIEs working in other countries. Originality/value This is the first study to examine how emotional resilience may mediate the relationship between stressors and SIEs' intent to remain and also considered the possible moderating effects of cultural novelty. In addition, unlike most studies that focus only on the negative outcomes of hindrance stressors, this study tested the possible positive effects of challenge stressors.",art

PurposeDrawing on social exchange literature, this study explores the mediating role of affective commitment between employees' assessments of contract breaches and opportunistic silence, along with the invigorating effect of hostile attribution bias.Design/methodology/approachWe tested the hypotheses using multi-wave data collected from employees working in higher education institutions in Pakistan.FindingsPerceived contract breaches elicit intentional, selfish and retaliatory motives of silence, largely because employees lack emotional attachments to their organization. This mechanism is more prominent among employees who tend to blame others and perceive them as antagonistic even when they are not.Practical implicationsFor human resource managers, this investigation highlights a crucial feature - affective commitment - by which employees' perceptions of psychological contract breaches facilitate opportunistic silence. Our results suggest that this process is more likely to intensify when employees have distorted thinking, motivating them to attribute the worst motives to their employer's actions.Social implicationsPerceived contract breaches within universities can have far-reaching societal consequences, affecting trust, reputation, economic stability, and the overall quality and accessibility of education and research. Addressing and preventing such breaches is essential to maintaining the positive societal role of universities.Originality/valueThis study provides novel insights into the process that underlies the connection between perceived contract breach and opportunistic silence by revealing the hitherto overlooked role of employees' hostile attribution bias, which renders them more susceptible to experiencing unfavorable forms of social exchange.",art

PurposeHuman-animal interactions (HAIs) have been found to have an extensive and significant influence on individuals' well-being and health-related outcomes. However, there are few studies that examine this influence on work-related contexts, such as teleworking. In this study, the author relied on the affective events theory to examine the effect of daily HAI on employees' daily work engagement and the underlying mechanisms (daily affect ratio and state mindfulness), by resorting to a daily diary study.Design/methodology/approachTo test the hypotheses, the author collected daily data during five consecutive working days with pet owners (N = 400 x 5 = 2,000).FindingsMultilevel results showed that interacting with pets during the working day was positively associated with daily work engagement, but this positive relationship was stronger for individuals with lower levels of mindfulness. Further analyses showed that the daily affect ratio mediated the moderating effect of mindfulness on the relationship between daily interactions with pets and daily work engagement.Practical implicationsThese findings provide strong support for the proposed mediated moderation model; indeed, positive affect and mindfulness help to explain the positive effect of HAIs on work engagement. Hence, managers may consider the adoption of teleworking, even in a hybrid format for those workers who own pets, because interacting with pets may be a strategy to make them feel more positive and, in turn, more enthusiastic, dedicated and absorbed in their work.Originality/valueThis study is one of the first studies to demonstrate the importance of adopting pet-friendly practices, such as allowing pet owners to telework, as a way to promote daily work engagement.",art

PurposeThis research seeks to unpack a relevant, hitherto overlooked connection between employees' perception that family incivility is undermining their work and their displays of submissive behavior. The authors predict and test a mediating role of employees' work alienation beliefs and a moderating role of their ego resilience in this connection.Design/methodology/approachThe research hypotheses were tested with survey data collected in three rounds, separated by three weeks each, among employees who work in the education sector in Pakistan. The statistical analyses relied on the PROCESS macro, which supports the simultaneous estimation of the direct, mediation and moderated mediation effects that underpin the proposed theoretical framework.FindingsAn important reason that victims of disrespectful treatment at home fail to fight for their rights at work is that they develop parallel beliefs of being disconnected from work. This intermediary role of work alienation beliefs is less prominent though when employees can rely on their personal resource of ego resilience.Practical implicationsFor human resource (HR) managers, this research offers a critical explanation, related to a sense of being estranged from work, for why family-induced work hardships might cause employees to exhibit subservient behaviors at work. It further reveals how this process can be contained if employees have the capability to adapt flexibly to different situations.Originality/valueThis study contributes to extant research by explicating how and when family-induced work hardships might escalate into work responses that mirror employees' experiences at home.",art

Purpose The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly disrupted the traditional ways for organizations to function, mandating their prompt adaptation and reaction to issues related to employees, operations, and communication. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to report on a total quality management (TQM) implementation as a sample motivational case to support the need for a new work from anywhere (WFA) stakeholder framework that can be used by other companies as they build, maintain, and continuously improve a WFA culture and environment for successful Quality 4.0 and COVID-19 initiatives. Design/methodology/approach Quality 4.0 that specifies an adaptive quality environment can help organizations quickly identify and respond to problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyzing a Lean Six Sigma implementation through the lens of Quality 4.0 in a case study, the authors propose a new stakeholder engagement framework for companies to build, maintain, and continuously improve the culture and environment for facilitating social interactions. Findings The authors' proposed framework consists of three major phases: (1) identify and plan stakeholder management, (2) manage stakeholder engagement, and (3) sustain stakeholder engagement. The first phase entails organizations supporting a culture of trust, engaging, and empowering stakeholders, identifying stakeholders, planning for stakeholder management, and inquiring about problems in the process. The second phase requires engaging stakeholders via participatory buy-in. The third phase focuses on monitoring stakeholder relationships, including modifying strategies and plans. Practical implications This study bears some valuable implications for practitioners. First, the stakeholder management process should be established upon a culture that promotes trust, engagement, and empowerment. Second, the authors identify tools that can assist in the execution of WFA activities. Third, the organizational team needs to actively manage the WFA stakeholders and then sustain the stakeholder relationships. Finally, the implementation of the framework herein can be supported and strengthened by tools and techniques that promote participation and buy-in from stakeholders to ensure the project team hears, trusts, and values their contributions.

10.1108/PR-10-2021-0704,"Employer's investments in job crafting to promote knowledge worker's sustainable employability: a moderated mediation model. Purpose The primary study purpose is to examine whether managerial support triggers job crafting and sustainable employability, and to what extent work uncertainty moderates the managerial support and sustainable employability relationships mediated by job crafting using a moderated mediation approach. Thus, this study aims to uncover new antecedent and outcomes of job crafting using job demands and resources (JD-R) theory as no such research has yet examined these relationships. Design/methodology/approach The structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was employed to test the proposed relationships based on survey data that include a final 483 knowledge workers of the services sector. The authors tested the structural model using self-developed estimates for AMOS 24.0 to examine the moderated mediation process models (process models 7, 14 and 58) rather than using a conventional process macro through SPSS. Findings Consistent with the formulated hypothesis, the results of this study indicate that managerial support directly stimulates job crafting and sustainable employability. Further, job crafting mediates the relationships between managerial support and sustainable employability. This validates the JD-R theory assumption that managerial support as job resources initiates a motivational process through job crafting, leading to sustainable employability as the outcome of the motivational process. Additionally, the moderated mediation results show that in the presence of high work uncertainty, employees are more engaged in job crafting to boost their sustainable employability. Practical implications Organizations may incorporate these findings while developing human resources (HR) management policies and practices to align top-down and bottom-up job re(design) approaches. For example, by designing line managers' role in implementation of supportive HR practices, their supportive leadership behavior towards employees will successfully trigger job crafting and nurture their sustainable employability. Originality/value This research adds to the work design and employability literature. No such study has yet examined whether managerial support triggers job crafting and sustainable employability. Prior studies examine personality traits, some individual difference variable, job characteristics, or leadership influence as antecedents of job crafting. Utilizing the JD-R theory, we empirically validate that job crafting plays a vital role in the motivational process initiated by the job resources (managerial support), leading to sustainable employability as an outcome of the motivational process. The authors further show that in the presence of high job demands (work uncertainty), employees are more engaged in job crafting and more conscious to boost their sustainable employability.",art

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the power dynamics between the client firm and the supplier firm in the information technology outsourcing (ITO) supplier chain influence the supplier firm's human resource management (HRM) practices, particularly talent retention. Design/methodology/approach A multi-case study approach was adopted comprising four supplier firms, three client firms and a total of 53 interviews. The transaction cost economics (TCE) is the theoretical lens that guides the interpretation of our findings. Findings The power dynamics between client and supplier firms in the ITO supply chain is one underpinned by TCE theory, characterised by an asymmetric client-dominated, transactional relationship, with the client firms controlling the why, the what, and the how dimensions of their collaboration. This three-dimensional control led to high talent turnover in supplier firms, which boomerangs to perpetuate the power dynamic, forming vicious cycles of talent turnover in the ITO supplier chain. Originality/value No previous study has analysed power dynamics as an external factor on ITO supplier firms' talent retention. The construct of the three-dimensional-control offers a framework to study power dynamics in the ITO supplier chain. The study's framework of the vicious cycles of talent turnover is the first that explains the mechanisms through which the power dynamics in the ITO influences supplier's talent retention.",art

10.1108/PR-03-2021-0174,"When can felt accountability promote innovative work behavior? The role of transformational leadership. Purpose Studies have reported negative effects of felt accountability on employees' extra-role behavior. Deviating from that focus, this study proposes that leadership plays a role in shaping the implications of felt accountability for employees' extra-role behavior. We propose that under high transformational leadership, felt accountability can motivate employees to engage in task-relevant information elaboration and facilitate innovative work behavior, a form of extra-role behavior that seeks to improve the work environment. Design/methodology/approach We conducted a pilot study to validate measurements of felt accountability and task-relevant information elaboration in a sample of 202 employees. We then conducted the main study using a time-lagged, multisource survey design with a sample of 120 supervisor-employee pairs. Findings The results from the main study reveal that the association between felt accountability and task-related information elaboration is positive and stronger when transformational leadership is higher. Furthermore, task-relevant information elaboration positively predicts innovative work behavior. Finally, when transformational leadership is higher, the mediation effect of task-relevant information elaboration on the association between felt accountability and innovative work behavior is stronger. Originality/value Our study indicates that felt accountability can have positive implications for employees' extra-role behavior contingent on leadership styles. In contrast to previous studies that emphasize the negative implications of felt accountability on employees' behavior, our study depicts when and why felt accountability can have positive implications on employees' behavior.",art
10.1108/PR-04-2020-0304,"Leading Machiavellians on the road to better organizational behavior. Purpose Studies highlighting negative behavioral influences of Machiavellians are plentiful; however, those prescribing their management are scarce. Machiavellians are intelligent, adaptable and resourceful people with negative, self-serving and unethical persona traits. Their abundance in organizations poses a challenge for managers in minimizing negative consequences of Machiavellian's manipulative behaviors and tap into their true potential. Leadership can play a crucial role in this regard. This purpose of this paper is to investigate the moderating effects of transformational leadership (TFL) versus transactional leadership (TSL) styles on the relationship between subordinates' Machiavellianism and their organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and counterproductive work behavior (CWB). The aim was to highlight the style that better adept in managing high-Mach subordinates. Design/methodology/approach This cross-sectional study used multiple surveys administered to 90 managers and their 269 subordinates from 56 organizations. Multiple regression was used for testing and hypothesize linear and supplementary nonlinear relationships between the study variables. Findings After a detailed data analysis, authors posit that, as compared to TFL, the TSL style is better suited for managing Machiavellian subordinates. Practical implications By employing transactional tactics, leaders can reign in the divergent behavior of Machiavellians, thus, transforming them into useful organizational assets. Originality/value This study expands on limited body of knowledge on managing Machiavellians. It advocates using TSL for improving the OCB of Machiavellians while countering their CWBs. Furthermore, this study contributes to transactional/transformational theories as it lends credence to the situational theory of leadership.",art

Purpose The present study aims to determine the effect of adopting voice on subordinates' work engagement based on organization-based self-esteem (OBSE). Design/methodology/approach Three variables were rated according to the seven-point Likert-type response scales. To control the effect of common method variance, an online survey was conducted to collect data from 206 samples at Chinese firms by employing a two-wave and time-lagged approach. In addition, structure equation modeling analysis was adopted to verify the hypotheses with Mplus 7. Findings Leaders' adoption of employee voice shows a positive association with employee OBSE and work engagement. OBSE is positively associated with work engagement and mediates the effect of adopting voice on work engagement. Practical implications As suggested from the mentioned results, organizations are required to encourage leaders to adopt employees' reasonable voice that can be an effective management tool impacting employee work engagement. Originality/value Though existing studies have discussed the effects of leader behaviors on subordinates' work engagement, the effect of leaders' adoption of employee voice on employee work engagement has been rarely studied. Based on the job demand-resource model, this study fills the gap by empirically examining the effect of adopting voice on work engagement. As indicated by the findings here, leaders' adoption of employee voice enhances employee OBSE, thereby facilitating work engagement. The present study provides insights to stimulate employee work engagement.",art

PurposeUnderpinned by the exit-voice and work design models, this study investigates how work autonomy reduces employee turnover intentions and promotes voice behavior via the mediator of skill utilization and how this mediation process is moderated by social (learning from colleagues) and personality (future time orientation) characteristics.Design/methodology/approachThe hypothesized moderated mediation model was tested using regression analysis based on two-wave survey data of 350 Chinese employees.FindingsThe relationships between work autonomy on the one hand and voice behavior and turnover intentions on the other were mediated by skill utilization. Furthermore, such mediated relationships were intensified by collegial learning and future time orientation.Practical implicationsAdopting empowering HR practices (e.g. autonomous work teams and job rotation) that give employees job control and learning opportunities is important to encourage employee voice and reduce turnover.Originality/valueThe paper identifies collegial learning and future time orientation as boundary conditions that regulate the effects of work autonomy. This reconciles the contradictory findings in prior research testing the relationship between autonomy and exit-voice decisions.",art

Purpose - Human Resource Management (HRM) is a critical organizational function, which has continued to evolve. We aim to explore how different HRM will be in the workplace of the future and why, from both strategic and practical perspectives. We present and discuss core HRM practices, such as recruitment, selection and training, as well as peripheral activities, such as monitoring health and safety, and diversity management, reflecting on how they may transform in the workplace of the future. Design/methodology/approach - This is a conceptual thought piece, building on the Substitution, Augmentation, Modification and Redefinition (SAMR) model, to offer a futuristic view of HRM in the era of AI. Findings - Discussing the contemporary challenges of Artificial Intelligence, which we predict will lead to what we term Cyborging HRM. Practical implicationsThis study can help HR managers and practitioners to be prepared for AI-embedded HRM systems in the future. For academics, it offers an innovative framework to establish future writing on HRM in the AI era. Originality/value - AI is pushing HRM and the profession will have to undergo a revolutionary rather than evolutionary transformation in order to remain a necessary and valuable function for organizations.

Purpose - Starting from the relevance of ethics to the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of employee recruitment and selection (R&S), in this article, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of the literature in light of the main ethical theories (utilitarian theories, theories of justice, and theories of rights) to identify a future research agenda and practical implications. Design/methodology/approach - On the basis of the best-quality and most influential journals, we conducted a systematic review of 120 articles from two databases (Web of Science and Scopus) to provide descriptive results and adopt a framework for deductive classification of the main topics. Findings - Inspired by the three ethical theories, we identified three thematic lines of enquiry for the debate on AI in R&S: (1) the utilitarian view: the efficient optimisation of R&S through AI; (2) the justice view: the perceptions of justice and fairness related to AI techniques; and (3) the rights view: the respect for legal and human rights requirements when AI is applied. Originality/value - This article provides a detailed assessment of the adoption of AI in the R&S process from the standpoint of traditional ethics theories and offers an integrative theoretical framework for future research on AI in the broader field of HRM.",art

PurposeThe paper aims to clarify the relationship between organizational work-family practices and employee work-family conflict in light of the boundary conditions of commitment-based human resource management (HRM) and employee human capital.Design/methodology/approachThe paper opted for a multi-source, multi-level design and surveyed 1,717 individuals (including CEOs, HR managers and employees) from 159 firms in China. The model was tested using hierarchical linear modeling.FindingsThe paper provides empirical insights that the effect of work-family practices on work-family conflict is indispensably dependent on the adoption of commitment-based HRM. In addition, employee human capital further moderated this interaction in that the effect of work-family practices on reducing work-family conflict was most salient with high-education employees who were embedded in a high-commitment HRM system.Research limitations/implicationsTesting the hypotheses in the Chinese context has both its merits and drawbacks. Specific results are pursuant to the Chinese context. Therefore, a cross-cultural comparative study is called upon.Practical implicationsThe paper includes implications for organizations striving to minimize employee work-family conflict.Originality/valueThis paper primarily applies the resource-building perspective to examine the synergistic effects of organizational resources (targeting work-family practices together with general commitment-based HRM) and individual intellectual resources (human capital) on employee work family conflict.",art

PurposeThe COVID-19 pandemic forced many employees to work from home, resulting in new demands that might cause older workers to reevaluate their retirement decisions. Building on the extended Job Demands-Resources model, which explains work-related outcomes in times of crisis, this study investigated the change in older workers' intention to continue working during COVID-19 and the role of ICT-related strain and social support during teleworking.Design/methodology/approachA two-wave longitudinal study was conducted among 1,406 older workers (i.e. 50 years or older). Data were collected before the COVID-19 pandemic (2019: T1) and during the pandemic (2021: T2). In total, 967 older workers completed the survey at both waves.FindingsOlder workers' nearing retirement experienced a decline in intentions to continue working during the pandemic, while intentions of older workers further away from their retirement increased. At T2, the negative relationship between telework intensity and the intention to continue working was mediated by ICT-related strain. Perceived social support at work seems to buffer the negative impact of telework intensity on ICT-related strain.Originality/valueThis study provides valuable insights into factors that may stimulate older workers' workforce participation by investigating effects of ICT-related strain and social support during telework. Organizations can implement interventions that enhance job resources and reduce job demands during telework to help mitigate ICT-related strain and postpone retirement.",art

PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to critically study the implementation and contextualization of the human resource transformation (HRT) management model within the human resources (HR) function of a global industrial company group.Design/methodology/approachA qualitative case study that includes two data collections.FindingsImplementation of the HRT model led to tensions and conflicting interpretations of the mission of the HR function, and a tug of war about the distribution of work both within HR and between HR and line management. Splitting the HR function into three legs made the HR function's learning cycles more difficult. The corporate group had a decentralized and diverse business culture, and contextualization of the HRT model to this setting highlighted the model's embeddedness in the American business culture of centralization and standardization. Implementation of the model also entailed a transition from an employee to an employer perspective within HR.Research limitations/implicationsFor an assessment of HR's total work other parts of the HRT model (Ulrich and Brockbank, 2005) need to be involved since HR professionals in the insourced or outsourced shared service center (SSC) and Center of Expertise (CoE) and the e-HR tools are equally important for executing the total HR's mission. Further studies of the problematic human resource business partner (HRBP) role are needed and also what the development of e-HR solutions means for the HR profession.Practical implicationsThe authors argue for a continuous development of HR work, along with closer professional contact both with line managers (LMs) and within the HR function, for improved learning cycles and a need for contextualization when implementing management models.Social implicationsThe paper discusses the HRT model's impact on HR practitioners' and LMs' work practice.Originality/valueThis article shows the need for contextualization when implementing management models. The lack of such contextualization led to severe tensions, and the intentions of an efficient and respected HR function were not achieved. The study contributes an evaluation of the tensions between HRT as a normative and standardized model in business settings accustomed to variety and decentralized decision-making.",art

Purpose Using social information processing and sense-making theory, the current study examines how the poly-contextual factors and social environment of employees provide unique cues and shape an employee's person-job (PJ) fit perceptions in ways that enable males to perceive a better PJ fit than their female counterparts at work. These perceptions of PJ fit act as mediating processes between gender-based differences in HR commitment or HR control attributions. Design/methodology/approach After collecting two waves of data over a six-month period from a sample of 498 banking sector professionals in Pakistan, the hypothesized relationships were tested using hierarchical multiple regression. Findings It was found that gender (female) was positively related to HR control attributions and negatively related to PJ fit perceptions and HR commitment attributions. The mean differences between males and females concerning these study variables were significant. Also, PJ fit mediated the relationship between gender and HR attributions. Originality/value The study contributes to the advancement and understanding of the predictors of HR attributions by examining the poly-contextual factors that shape unique experiences, knowledge structures and social information processing, thus forming distinct PJ fit perceptions and subsequent HR commitment or control attributions for males and females.",art

Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of job seekers' perceived incivility during job search on their job search intensity via job search-specific self-esteem, and to explore how the job seekers' level of dispositional mindfulness buffers these relationships. Design/methodology/approach Using self-report measures, time-lagged data were obtained from 242 graduating students of a Chinese university. Findings Results showed that perceived incivility during job search was negatively related to job search-specific self-esteem, and that job search-specific self-esteem was positively related to job search intensity. Further, dispositional mindfulness mitigated the direct link between perceived incivility and job search-specific self-esteem and the indirect link between job seekers' perception of incivility and job search intensity through job search-specific self-esteem. Originality/value By integrating the recruitment and job search literature, we investigated how negative experiences (perceived incivility during recruitment) stemming from the context of job search influence the motivation of job seekers to continue their job search via the mediating role of job search-specific self-esteem. Further, for the first time, we explored the moderating role of dispositional mindfulness in the job search literature by utilizing the framework of positive psychology.",art

Purpose Nigeria is experiencing an expanding variety of what is termed collective bargaining, which is being propelled by socio-economic challenges and the emerging political dispensation that had long eluded the country, albeit the numerous contours needing some pragmatic approaches from the state, employers of labour and the trade unions at the local and national levels. Therefore, this study represents an attempt to illustrate the rising collective bargaining pattern in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach This study drew on employee and employer sectoral associations examples together with labour union structures of the state to assess what underlined collective bargaining developments from the broad context of collective bargaining and the industrial relations implications. Content analysis was employed to analyse the secondary data (found in relevant company handbooks, policies, collective agreements, etc.) and primary data obtained through unstructured interviews. Findings A form of collective bargaining is emerging where the trade unions are embracing symbiotic agreements at plant levels to improve conditions of employment and thus weakening the hold of the national union from collective bargaining - a move that may challenge the conceptual framework of collective bargaining as conceived by many states in developing economies. Originality/value This is an investigative paper, carefully trailing the framework of collective bargaining from direct contacts with all stakeholders in the labour corridors of Nigeria - such as the Nigeria Labour Congress, Nigeria Employers' Consultative Association, Chemical and Non-Metallic Products Employer's Federation, Metal Products Workers Union of Nigeria and Personnel Practitioners, cutting across all the segments of the political and economic development of the country.",art
10.1108/PR-05-2021-0330,"A moderated mediation model of counterproductive work behaviour, organisational justice, organisational embeddedness and psychological ownership. Purpose This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms through which organisational justice influences counterproductive work behaviour (CWB). This relationship was explained using a moderated mediation model where organisational embeddedness is a mediator between organisational justice and CWB, while psychological ownership (for the organisation) is a moderator of the relationship between organisational embeddedness and CWB. The conservation of resources (COR) theory was used as the underpinning theory to explain the interrelationships among the constructs. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected by administering a quantitative cross-sectional survey to employees of Punjab Police, a large public sector, law enforcement organisation in Pakistan. The study model was analysed using PLS-SEM to address the treatment of higher-order reflective-formative constructs. Findings The results showed that organisational justice is positively related to organisational embeddedness, while organisational embeddedness is negatively related to CWB. Organisational embeddedness was found to play a significant role in mediating the negative effects of organisational justice on CWB. Also, psychological ownership moderated the influence of organisational embeddedness on CWB in an interesting fashion. CWB was the highest when both embeddedness and ownership were low; however, CWB was not the lowest when both embeddedness and ownership were high. Research limitations/implications Reliance on self-report data, not accounting for the community embeddedness and discounting the differential effects of justice dimensions are some of the limitations of the present study. Despite these limitations, this study offers valuable insights into how the occurrence of CWB can be minimised. That is, apart from providing a work environment based on fair procedures and policies, it is critically important to manage the perceptions of embeddedness and psychological ownership of employees. Originality/value Although numerous researchers have studied the link between organisational justice and CWB, few have explored the roles of organisational embeddedness and psychological ownership in this relationship. This study thus posits a novel moderated mediation mechanism, based on the COR theory, through which organisational justice is translated into CWB. Moreover, this study adds value by investigating this model in the police force context, where justice and CWB have important consequences.",art

Purpose The purpose of this article is to examine the communicative factors that facilitate or hamper the development of an inclusive work environment with an emphasis on the communication about equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI), while taking diversity characteristics of employees into account. Design/methodology/approach In total, 84 persons employed in Austria and Germany, who feature various observable and non-observable diversity characteristics, were interviewed following a problem-centered approach. Findings The results indicate that employees with (observable) diversity characteristics, who tend to feel less included, observe more excluding and marginalizing communication and practices in their organizations. Moreover, formal interpersonal communication appears to be more important to develop a highly inclusive workplace than informal interpersonal communication and other forms of communication about EDI. Research limitations/implications The sample was rather imbalanced and comprised only employees in Austria and Germany, which limits the study's explanatory power. However, the findings stress the significance of formal interpersonal communication as the cornerstone of an inclusive workplace, which should be followed up in future research. Practical implications In terms of the development of an inclusive work environment the findings suggest that strategic (i.e. formal) organizational communication about EDI issues is key to increase the perception of inclusion. Originality/value This paper contributes to the literature by demonstrating the importance of interpersonal communication as a key factor that facilitates, but also hampers an inclusive work environment.",art

Purpose In the current study framework, the authors test the underlying assumptions of affective events theory concerning the impact of job satisfaction and job insecurity driven by incivility on intrapreneurial behaviour. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected with a sample of 510 employees from five organisations. All hypotheses were tested via SmartPLS3. Additionally, a distinction between formative and reflective measures was performed. Findings Findings revealed that incivility decreases intrapreneurial behaviour, mediated by job satisfaction and job insecurity. Additionally, this study's results show that the relationship between job satisfaction and job insecurity and intrapreneurial behaviour distinguishes unionised employees from employees who are not unionised. Research limitations/implications The cross-sectional nature of the present data precluded definitive statements about causality. Additionally, further studies should increase the sample size and include an international perspective to ensure the overall generalisability of the results. Practical implications Practically, this study's findings point to the need for organisational management to understand better underlying employees' perceptions and their antecedents and consequences. Originality/value The study results contribute to the literature by testing the core assumptions of affective events theory and by extending the affective events theory model, incorporating contextual influences on the relationship between attitudes and behaviours. The authors also show for the first time that incivility can be directly (compared to indirectly) linked to emotional-based responses, but not to those responses driven by cognitive appraisals. Thus, the study also contributes to the incivility literature and the understanding of various antecedents and consequences of incivility. Additionally, this study addressed the notion of formative versus reflective measurement models for the first time relating to incivility and intrapreneurial behaviour, allowing for more sensitive and less biased results. Herein lies an additional methodological contribution.",art

This paper investigates the impact of job control and work-related loneliness on employee work behaviors and well-being during the massive and abrupt move to remote work amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We draw on job-demands control and social baseline theory to link employee perceived job control and work-related loneliness to emotional exhaustion and work-life balance and posit direct and indirect effects on employee minor counterproductive work behaviors, depression, and insomnia. Using a two-wave data collection with a sample of U.S. working adults to test our predictions, we find that high job control was beneficially related to emotional exhaustion and work-life balance, while high work-related loneliness showed detrimental relationships with our variables of interest. Moreover, we find that the beneficial impact of high perceived job control was conditional on individual segmentation preferences such that the effects were stronger when segmentation preference was low. Our research extends the literature on remote work, job control, and workplace loneliness. It also provides insights for human resource professionals to manage widespread remote work that is likely to persist long after the COVID-19 pandemic.",art
10.1002/hrm.22095,"Navigating the era of disruption: How emotions can prompt job crafting behaviors. Environmental disruptions can disturb the status quo. This can create the need for employees to navigate rapidly evolving demands in their work environment, often before formalized strategic plans can be developed and/or implemented. As such, understanding how employees experience and respond to these disruptions is critical for effective strategic human resource management. Drawing on appraisal theories of emotion, we argue that employees' appraisals of how the disruption has impacted their work can elicit discrete emotions (e.g., frustration and pride). In turn, these emotions can encourage employees to address challenges and opportunities by engaging in job crafting behaviors. Importantly, job crafting behaviors can have implications for subsequent employee outcomes (e.g., performance and well-being). We test our predictions using a three-wave survey (N = 402) in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic-an unexpected environmental disruption that sparked rapid change. Theoretically, our findings provide insight into why and how employees can self-initiate changes to their jobs in response to environmental disruptions as well as how job crafting behaviors impact employee outcomes. Practically, our findings provide insight and guidance to SHRM practitioners on how to effectively support and manage employees before, during, and after environmental disruptions.",art

This research investigates the impact of algorithmic management on worker behaviors, focusing on workers' commitment to service quality and referral tendencies. Drawing upon the job demands-resources model, we argue that high levels of algorithmic management could create hindrance demands that impede service quality and demotivate referral behaviors. We propose that high workload, as a challenge demand, buffers the negative effects of algorithmic management on worker outcomes. We find support for our proposed research model in an experiment with a sample of 1362 platform-based food-delivery riders. We also conduct a qualitative study with 21 riders, which provides a more nuanced understanding of how algorithmic management affects workers' attitudes, behaviors, and referral tendencies.",art

We tested our model among a multisource sample of 610 leaders across 18 industries and 21 job functions who participated in a leader development program. Leader humility was reported by the focal leaders' peers, leader mentoring behavior was reported by the focal leaders' direct reports, leader status was reported by the focal leaders' immediate bosses, and leader promotability was reported by the focal leaders' superiors.

10.1002/hrm.22203,"Power to the people-And then? A multilevel leadership perspective on organizational decentralization. As organizations strive for more flexibility, decentralized decision-making has been at the core of many modern HR approaches. Yet, on a company-wide scale, it remains unclear whether decentralized decision-making structures improve organizational performance. Our study aims to illuminate prior ambiguous evidence by examining an employee-level mechanism underlying the organizational-level relationship between decentralization and performance, and scrutinizing the critical role of formal leaders for empowering employees in decentralized structures. Integrating the perspective of organizational structure as opportunities and constraints with social information processing theory, we argue that transferring decision-making authority to lower organizational levels positively affects employees' emergent leadership, but only to the extent that direct supervisors engage in empowering leadership and guide employees' behaviors in decentralized structures. Our predictions are supported by a multilevel, multisource field study of 5807 individuals across 144 companies. We further find that emergent leadership yields a positive effect on organizational performance. By developing a multilevel model that explicates both an employee-level mechanism and a contingency of the decentralization-organizational performance link, our study enriches understanding of the key role that formal leaders play for achieving the strategic goals of decentralized decision-making in organizations.",art
10.1002/hrm.22146,"Strong signals in HR management: How the configuration and strength of an HR system explain the variability in HR attributions. In explaining the effectiveness of a human resource (HR) system within an organization, scholars have turned their attention to HR attributions, which capture employees' perceptions about the intentions behind their organization's HR practices, and have demonstrated that an HR system's content and process of communication drive employees to form specific HR attributions. However, current research has not yet explained why HR attributions differ among employees. We investigate the variability in HR attributions among individuals and the organizational factors that influence this variability. Using signaling theory and the concept of situational strength, we argue that employees' HR attributions vary less when signals sent by HR management are unambiguous and the conveyed information is consistent. Using an online scenario-based experiment with 760 participants, our findings reveal that the configuration and the strength of an HR system as well as their combination have significant effects on the variability in HR attributions among employees, and these effects differ for the different HR attributions.",art
10.1002/hrm.22135,"The multiple roles of network ties in the employee job search process. Employee water cooler conversations with coworkers, as well as interpersonal interactions outside of one's employing organization, are key sources of information about the labor market. Although the value of network ties for job search is well recognized, research to date has tended to focus on how network ties relate to job search outcomes, providing little insight into what types of network ties offer information that shape job seeker perceptions and behaviors throughout the job search process. Drawing from Steel's (2002) evolutionary search model and social network research, we assert that different types of network ties-those that are weak versus strong and those internal versus external to the organization-offer different types of labor market information, which impacts employees' labor market perceptions, propensity to search for employment, and job search effectiveness. Using a time-separated research design in a sample of healthcare workers, we find weak external ties are associated with more optimistic perceptions of the labor market, increased marketability, and early-stage job search, and strong external ties are associated with greater marketability and propensity to engage in an early-stage job search. Strong internal ties (SITs) have dual, opposing influences on employee job search: SITs are associated with less early-stage job search, but they are also associated with increased concrete prospects when employees are more actively seeking alternative employment. Taken together, this study provides more nuanced insights into how network ties influence employee job search processes, clarifying ambiguities in this literature.",art
10.1002/hrm.22115,"The HR ecosystem framework: Examining strategic HRM tensions in knowledge-intensive organizations with boundary-crossing professionals. In this article, we use Snell & Morris' (2021) new HR ecosystem framework to empirically examine strategic fit and alignment tensions for knowledge-intensive organizations and professional knowledge workers. Rich data were collected through in-depth interviews with 75 members of faculty engaged in knowledge-intensive work for Business and Management Schools (B&M), and the analysis of strategy documents. The application of the framework enables us to contribute to dynamic capabilities theory and SHRM in four ways. Firstly, drawing on the findings, we propose an adapted HR Ecosystem framework for analyzing knowledge-intensive organizations, which incorporates tensions across the four subsystems of an HR ecosystem (strategy, capabilities, composition, and cultures). These tensions are shaped by interactions within and between levels (meso, macro and micro) and ecosystems. Secondly, our findings underscore the need for knowledge-intensive organizations to engage with a plurality of collaborative and competing internal and external stakeholder interests, including those of knowledge workers who constitute key organizational stakeholders. Thirdly, our analysis shows how the views and behaviors of internal organizational stakeholders are affected by ecosystem dynamics within and beyond the physical boundaries of an organization. Fourthly, we reveal how conflicting organizational cultures connect with other HR ecosystem subsystems to constrain collegialism and cohesion. By evidencing how knowledge-intensive organizations are in a constant flux of alignment and misalignment, the article demonstrates the value of the HR ecosystem framework in examining and informing SHRM in organizations in other industries.",art

We draw on deonance theory and social learning theory to propose a framework that explains how individual team members with varying levels of leader-member exchange (LMX) with their team leader have different emotional and behavioral responses upon observing teammate-directed abusive supervision. After employing a social relations paradigm with two-wave round-robin data collected from a sample of 378 engineers on 89 work teams, we did not find that witnessing teammate-targeted abusive supervision increased sympathy for the targeted teammates, but we did find that observers with a higher level of LMX were more likely to legitimize such abuse and less likely to sympathize with its victims. Furthermore, we found that for individuals with a higher level of LMX, perceiving leaders' abusive supervision of teammates was negatively related to providing help to those teammates through the mediating role of sympathy for the teammates.",art

Such mistreatment poses a significant challenge from the human resource management (HRM) perspective as finding and retaining competent social care workers is a global challenge. However, only a few studies focus on the relationship between such mistreatment and social care workers' job and psychological resources. Drawing on the conservation of resources (COR) theory, our study sheds light on the relationship between social care recipients' incivility and the resilience of social care workers. Specifically, our study examines the mediating role of work meaningfulness on the care recipient incivility-care worker resilience link, and the moderating role of servant leadership on this mediated relationship. To test the proposed moderated mediation model, two studies were conducted in social care organizations in England (n = 248) and Romania (n = 296). Our results revealed that perceived care recipient incivility is indirectly and negatively related to care workers' resilience by undermining their perceptions of work meaningfulness. Moreover, when social care workers work under a servant leader, this indirect relationship becomes weaker. The discussion elaborates on the findings of our model as well as the theoretical and practical implications for the management of human resources in social care organizations.",art
10.1002/hrm.22219,"When words are not enough: The combined effects of autism meta-stereotypes and recruitment practices aimed at attracting autistic job-seekers. Based on research on meta-stereotypes and signaling theory, we examined the effects of organizational signaling on the attraction of autistic applicants. Our model predicted that meta-stereotypes and the combination of expressed and evidence-based autism-conscious signals would have simple and joint effects on candidates' fit perceptions, which would, in turn, affect their job pursuit intentions. Further, we expected that the effect of signaling on our outcomes would be weaker among candidates with strong negative autism meta-stereotypes. Prior to testing our hypotheses, we conducted a focus group to determine the supports that autistic job seekers deemed most important. As the ability to work from home (WFH) was overwhelmingly the most cited support, we included this as our evidence-based signal. Specifically, we examined the combined effect of disability-conscious (vs. disability-blind) diversity statements and WFH (vs. retirement benefits) on expected fit and subsequent job pursuit intentions. Both meta-stereotypes and combined signals significantly influenced fit expectations. Further, the autism-friendly signals significantly affected the fit of candidates with weak and moderate negative meta-stereotype, but not the fit of candidates with strong meta-stereotypes. In addition, our results indicate that the signal x meta-stereotype interaction had an indirect effect on job pursuit intentions. Findings are discussed vis-a-vis the research on signaling theory and practical guidance is offered to employers seeking to attract the growing number of autistic job seekers.",art
10.1002/hrm.22151,"HR practices and work relationships: A 20 year review of relational HRM research. We systematically reviewed quantitative studies of phenomena at the nexus of Human Resource Management (HRM) and interpersonal relationships. We report on the overall prevalence and trends in research methods relating to construct, internal, external, and statistical conclusion validity. The review draws attention to areas of emphasis (positive relationships, instrumental ties, nonnetwork structures, employee respondents, samples drawn from Asia, HR perceptions). We also identify a growing emphasis on particularly desirable approaches to examining relational HRM (a more balanced consideration of positive and negative relationships, studies that examine more than one HR practice, multilevel analyses). Together, the identified areas of emphasis, gaps, and associated trends, inform our elucidation of research directions around 15 specific work relationships-along with more general directions for better accounting for dynamic, multilevel, measurement, and analytical considerations central to HRM and interpersonal relationships.",art
10.1002/hrm.22119,"The impact of organizational statements of support for the black community in the wake of a racial mega-threat on organizational attraction and revenue. When race-related injustices occur in society, organizations can respond by sending supportive signals to prospective and current employees. Using signaling theory (Spence, 1973), the current study examines the outcomes associated with organizations' public declarations of support for the Black community following race-related mega-threats (Leigh & Melwani, 2019). In Study 1, prospective employees evaluated a specific organization (Ben & Jerry's) that publicly supported the Black community following race-related mega-threats. Those who perceived higher levels of organizational support for diversity and inclusion (POSDI) reported higher organizational attraction (OA). Study 2 described a fictitious organization that responded to race-related mega-threats by messaging support for either Black Lives Matter (BLM), Blue Lives Matter, All Lives Matter, or no social movement. Prospective employees perceived higher levels of POSDI when the company issued a statement in support of BLM (relative to the other movements), which in turn was associated with higher OA. Study 3 focused on current employees and examined how POSDI influences financial outcomes in real Fortune 500 companies. Organizations that issued statements publicly supporting the Black community following a race-related mega-threat received higher POSDI ratings by employees, which predicted increased organizational revenue, even after controlling for revenue prior to making the statements. In sum, organizations that signal public support for the Black community in the wake of a race-related mega-threat not only increase prospective employees' POSDI, but may also boost OA and, ultimately, financial revenue.",art

Organizations must excel at what they do well while also learning new ways of operating to achieve long-term success. Work teams may thus find themselves pursuing contradictory objectives to support the organization's strategy. We investigated teams' goal orientation (in)congruence and its impact on task meaningfulness and, ultimately, performance, hypothesizing the potential pitfalls of teams simultaneously pursuing both learning- and performance-goal orientations. Three-wave, multisource data were collected from 109 teams at a large North American mortgage company. In a polynomial regression and response surface analytical framework, team task meaningfulness-and subsequent team performance-was enhanced when teams had greater divergence between their learning- and performance-goal orientations but suffered when both goal orientations were more aligned. Our investigation thus revealed the potential pitfalls of teams simultaneously pursuing both learning- and performance-goal orientations. We discuss the theoretical contributions of the team goal orientation incongruence effect substantiated in this study, as well as implications for practice and future research.",art

Safety literature has traditionally focused on identifying and managing risk factors that lead to safety outcomes (e.g., injuries, accidents, death) at work. The current study takes a new perspective on employee safety and proposes that safety-related experience has more general work implications. Drawing on theories of stress coping and workplace anxiety, we test a mechanism on how employees' daily experiences of safety threats are related to their work behavior via negative emotional reactions. Specifically, we focus on employees' experiences of safety violations on the way to work and at work during the ongoing struggles with COVID-19. Our daily diary study (Level 1 N = 778, Level 2 N = 84; office workers in South Korea) shows that experiencing safety violations during the daily commute and at work is associated with increased state health anxiety at work, which then translates into work withdrawal on that day. Furthermore, we introduce organizational safety climate as an important mitigating factor of this stress-coping process, as such a climate can emphasize management's commitment to safety.",art

Human resource leaders are experimenting with new approaches to organizing and utilizing workers that are not limited to the traditional boundaries of the firm, but rather expand to an ecosystem of work and organization. This special issue introduction article introduces a set of papers from management scholars discussing the ecosystem of work and organization and offers a roadmap for future research on HR ecosystems. An ecosystem perspective invites us to rethink our current frameworks to better link theory to practice. It also challenges us to shift our level of analysis from the organization to the ecosystem, asking: how is work organized and conducted within this complex and evolving context? These papers uncover trends related to (1) technological mediation, (2) impermanence and adaptation, and (3) shared governance. Our hope is that by framing these trends found within the research in this special issue that scholars will be provided a better road map in moving forward with their own research on the role of HR within the ecosystem of work and organization.",art
10.1002/hrm.22150,"Exploring the socio-political dynamics of front-line managers' HR involvement: A qualitative approach. Moving beyond the extant HR implementation research that has often viewed the implementation decisions primarily as front-line managers' (FLMs) prerogative, this article explores interactive processes involving three key actors: HR managers, senior managers, and FLMs. Drawing on a political lens, the authors find that the way in which FLMs enact HR practices depends on the relative power of the enforcing actors (i.e., HR managers) and the endorsing actors (i.e., senior managers). The study findings reveal that while the enforcers employ a range of influence tactics (e.g., legitimization, pressure, rational persuasion, and consultation) to facilitate strict HR enactment, the endorsers use counter-influence tactics (e.g., legitimization, assertiveness, and inspirational appeal) in support of deviant HR implementation behaviors. Carefully navigating both sides' influence tactics in light of past involvement experiences, FLMs choose subsequent implementation behaviors accordingly. The paper makes a meaningful contribution to the HR devolution research by delving into relational power dynamics that develop over an early phase of HR implementation. The resulting theoretical framework provides novel insights into the reasons behind FLMs' divergent forms of implementation behaviors. It shows that the ongoing multi-lateral interactions and political maneuverings involving HR-related actors trigger distinct HR involvement patterns.",art

PurposeGeneration Y early-career workers have the highest turnover rates ever seen. To better understand this phenomenon, this study combines the P-O values fit with the Cohort perspectives to (1) identify the work-related values of this generation, (2) explore the relation between values and turnover intentions and examine how the field of study influences this relationship and (3) verify if the turnover intentions materialized one year after the first data collection.Design/methodology/approachWe interviewed 71 early-career workers and applied thematic analysis to identify the value categories. A classification decision tree tested whether the field of study influences the relation between values and turnover intentions. A post-test was conducted to determine whether the reported turnover intentions were materialized one year later.FindingsThematic analysis yielded 285 themes that were grouped into 12 values' categories. Decision trees revealed that the combination of values that most predicted turnover was substantially different between Finance graduates (more instrumental and future-oriented values) and Innovation and Entrepreneurship graduates (more social and job-oriented values). The post-test confirmed that the number of respondents who reported an intention to quit their jobs during the interview with us and did quit one year later was statistically significant.Originality/valueTo our knowledge, this is the first study that uses critical incident interviews to explore the work-related values of this specific cohort and their relation to turnover.

PurposeIn a complex, ever-changing, and turbulent business world, encouraging employees to express their improvement-oriented novel ideas through voice behavior is crucial for organizations to survive and thrive. Understanding how to foster employee promotive voice at work is a significant issue for both researchers and managers. This study explores how to foster employee promotive voice through specific HRM practices and positive employee attitudes. It also examines the effect of employee promotive voice on perceived organizational performance.Design/methodology/approachThis study employed a time-lagged multisource survey design. Data were collected from 215 executives, 790 supervisors, and 1,004 employees in 113 firms, and analyzed utilizing a multilevel moderated serial mediation model.FindingsThe findings of this study revealed that promotive voice was significantly related to perceived organizational performance. Innovation-enhancing HRM was positively associated with employee promotive voice. The HRM-voice relationship was partially mediated by employee job satisfaction. Power distance orientation was found to significantly moderate the relationship between innovation-enhancing HRM and employee job satisfaction at the firm level. Our findings showed that innovation-enhancing HRM policies may fail to foster promotive voice if they do not enhance employee job satisfaction.Originality/valueThis study challenges some taken-for-granted assumptions in the literature such as any high performance HRM bundles (e.g. HPWS) can foster employee promotive voice, and the effects of HRM are direct and even unconditional on organizational outcomes. It emphasizes the need to avoid potential unintended effects of HRM on employee voice and the importance of contextualizing voice research.",art

Hierarchical regression and path analysis were conducted to test the hypotheses.FindingsFWE significantly mediated the positive relationships between the three subtypes of family social capital and career advancement. The effects of structural and cognitive family social capital, but not relational family social capital (RFSC), on FWE were stronger when POP was low (vs high).Research limitations/implicationsFWE is arguably a promising mechanism for explaining the links between family social capital and career outcomes. However, due to the cross-sectional nature of the data, conclusions regarding causality remain limited.Practical implicationsFamily social capital may enrich the careers of employees in collectivist cultures. Managers should mitigate their organization's political climate to promote employees' career advancement.Originality/valueThis study contributes to career research by linking family social capital to career outcomes through the lens of FWE for the first time and by identifying organizational politics as an important moderator that can influence the dynamics of resource enrichment in a collectivist culture.",art

Purpose - Idiosyncratic deals (i-deals) have been shown to influence several employee outcomes positively. To extend the research, the authors examine the effect of i-deals on employees' perceptions of organizational justice, in particular, how the relationship between employees' own i-deals and organizational justice is affected by employees' job performance as well as their perceptions of coworkers' i-deals.Design/methodology/approach - The authors tested the theoretical model using survey data from 182 hotel employees.Findings - Results show that i-deals are positively related to employees' perceptions of organizational justice and that such effects are stronger among high performing employees. The effect of i-deals on organizational justice was also more pronounced among employees who viewed coworkers as having successfully negotiated i-deals.Practical implications - The authors' findings suggest that organizations can benefit from providing i-deals through employees' enhanced perceptions of organizational justice. The paper thus recommends that organizations understand the impact of providing more flexible human resources (HR) practices and customized work arrangements that are aligned with individual goals and needs. This may be particularly relevant to high performers. Furthermore, the findings suggest that organizations may want to make i-deals available to employees more widely than to just a few selected individuals.Originality/value - This study is one of a few attempts that empirically investigate the relationship between i-deals and organizational justice. The findings of this study shed light on the possibility that employees develop positive justice perceptions toward employees' organization based on the appreciation of the customized work arrangements granted to both themselves and others.",art

Purpose Many organisations monitor statistics on the background of job applicants to inform diversity management, a practice known as equality monitoring (EM). The study examines perceptions of EM and employers that use it. Additionally, it aims to assess potentially salient group differences in attitudes towards EM, focussing on perceived history of employment discrimination, ethnicity, sex, and a comparison between the UK and Sweden - two countries which differ extensively in EM prevalence. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional self-report survey assessed attitudes toward EM, attraction to employers using it, pro-equality and diversity attitudes, perceived history of employment discrimination and background characteristics (e.g. ethnicity and sex), and compared a UK and Sweden sample (N = 925). Findings The results reveal positive perceptions of EM overall. Although no differences were observed between UK ethnic majority and minority respondents, White British men rate employers using EM as less attractive with increasing levels of perceived past discrimination. Women have more positive perceptions than men. Finally, the UK sample rated EM more positively than the Sweden sample. Originality/value Despite EM being widespread, the study is the first to investigate detailed perceptions of it, making group and country comparisons. Results support the use of EM in HRM but highlight the need for clear communication to avoid confusion with positive discrimination, which is perceived negatively in some majority group members, and to allay fears of data misuse.

Historically, research exploring employee deviance focussed on undesirable organisational and individual outcomes. Thus, previous research has empirically established that employee deviance harms both the organisation and organisation's employees. Recent studies argue that employee deviance also has a positive effect; however, such studies are limited in number. The extant research fails to consider the positive side of employee deviance, and therefore, the present studies bridge the gap through a systematic literature review on positive deviance. Design/methodology/approach The study examined peer-reviewed theoretical and empirical journal articles related to workplace deviance. An initial search resulted in 2,691 research articles, of which 40 papers were considered relevant for the study given the objective of this paper. Research papers were extracted from the Web of Science, EBSCO and Scopus. The extracted data were then synthesised to formulate the research questions and objectives for this study. Findings Basing on the systematic literature review, the study presents six main themes: positive deviance and younger workforce, positive deviant leader and subordinates and positive deviance as a strategic tool for employee engagement, positive deviance and positive organisational scholarship, positive deviance and entrepreneurial orientation. The study also proposes positive deviance as a mediator/moderator of other relationships within an organisation. Research limitations/implications Systematic literature is a methodology that relies on the availability and accessibility of research studies based on the research criteria. The study considered three significant databases to identify the relevant papers for the study. Therefore, the research is limited, and the possibility of omitting the papers is not ruled out, although unintentional. Originality/value The paper is plausibly the first research to conduct a systematic literature review on positive deviance. The study establishes and reconfirms the encouraging side of employee deviance. The study extends the literature on workplace deviance in two significant ways. First, the paper systematically examines the empirical and review literature related to positive deviance and presents a greater understanding of the predictors, consequences, methodologies, etc. Second, the study highlights the critical research gaps in this area and suggests the course of action for future research.",art

PurposePre-pandemic research demonstrated the challenges of the nursing workforce and the provision of quality of patient care. Such challenges have been significantly intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, not least in the workplace and fear of staff catching and transmitting COVID-19. We draw on conservation of resources (COR) theory to examine the impact of the fear of COVID-19 on nurses and the role of well-being-HRM (WBHRM) in negating the fear of COVID-19 and its impact on job stress and perceived quality of patient care.Design/methodology/approachWe collected data from 260 nurses (treating COVID-19 patients) employed in US hospitals across two-waves. Data were analyzed using mediated regression and moderated mediation.FindingsThe results indicated that when nurses report higher levels of fear of COVID-19, this translates into higher levels of nursing job stress. This, in turn, reduces nurses' perceptions of quality of patient care they can provide. As previous research has found, decreased perceptions of quality of patient care is a significant factor driving intentions to leave the profession. The results demonstrated that WBHRM practices buffer the negative impact of fear of COVID-19 on job stress, and in turn, the perceived quality of patient care.Originality/valueOur paper contributes to new knowledge for healthcare managers on WBHRM bundles and their efficacy in buffering the effects of fear on job stress and quality of patient care.

Purpose This paper uses conservation of resources theory to compare the impact of supervisor-employee relationships and the extent to which emotional contagion (EC) moderates the links between psychological capital (PsyCap) and well-being for United States (US) healthcare workers. Design/methodology/approach In this study structural equation modeling (SEM) and analysis of variances (ANOVAs) were used to test survey data collected at two points in time from 240 US doctors, nurses and allied health professionals. Findings The findings provide insight into why healthcare professionals, who undertake emotional labor, have a higher incidence of lower well-being and increased burnout rates compared with other jobs, except for emergency workers. The findings show that the relationship between PsyCap and well-being was different for low and high EC employees. The impact of PsyCap on well-being was greater for those with lower EC, and this means that those employees who have high EC have a greater risk of reduced well-being. Originality/value Traditional bureaucratic rationalist management models are inappropriate for managing those who have high EC and/or undertake emotional labor. Instead, new human resource (HR) models are needed that focus on employee well-being, and in providing greater organizational support and upskilling employees in how to cope with their emotions and to build their own reservoirs of personal support.",art

Purpose - Drawing upon the cross-cultural adjustment (CCA) model and self-determination theory, this study investigated the influence of CCA (work, interactional, and general adjustment) and motivation (autonomous and controlled) on the innovative work behavior of self-initiated expatriates (SIEs).Design/methodology/approach - Multi-source data were collected from 213 SIEs and their supervisors working in the United Arab Emirates to provide an understanding of the role of SIEs' CCA and motivation and their innovative work behavior.Findings - Findings indicated that work, interactional, and general adjustment are positively related to innovative work behavior. Autonomous motivation positively predicts innovative work behavior, while controlled motivation does not. Additionally, autonomous motivation moderated the effects of work adjustment and interactional adjustment on SIEs' innovative work behavior, whereas controlled motivation moderates the effect of general adjustment on SIEs' innovative work behavior.Originality/value - SIEs are regarded as talents that have the skills and valuable knowledge gained from their international experience and can be utilized in organizations to perform innovative work behaviors. However, SIEs face adjustment challenges that may hinder their ability to be innovative. Despite their potential as innovation drivers in organizations, there are few studies on the factors that affect SIEs' innovative behavior. This study contributes to the literature by examining the effects of adjustment and motivation on SIEs' innovative work behavior.",art

Purpose This study examines employee attraction and retention issues and uses a case study of an Australian regional medium-sized enterprise to highlight the importance of organisational context factors such as place and scale in designing human resource (HR) solutions. Design/methodology/approach The research presents a qualitative case study, with data drawn from strategic documents, interviews and focus groups, analysed thematically. Findings A carefully constructed set of HR strategies - including purposeful use of employer branding, synchronising of human resource management (HRM) formality and informality and capitalising on the regional context - are key to employee attraction and retention and in turn the growth and competitiveness of the case study organisation. Originality/value The HRM literature acknowledges the tendency to study larger corporations in metropolitan areas, at the expense of more nuanced research related to context. This research contributes to knowledge of attraction and retention through employer branding, with particular attention to scale and place, through study of a medium sized firm in a regional location. It highlights the importance of informality-formality dynamism.",art
10.1108/PR-04-2021-0305,"Modelling the interaction between serious leisure, self-perceived employability, stress, and workplace well-being: empirical insights from graduates in India. Purpose Drawing on a framework of Job Demands-Resources (JD-R), the purpose of this paper is to conceptually develop and empirically validate a moderated mediation model of serious leisure and workplace well-being. Design/methodology/approach The data were collected between December 2020 and March 2021 using an online questionnaire. A total of 225 completed questionnaires were received from employees in India who graduated between 2018 and 2020. Findings The authors' findings indicate that serious leisure is positively associated with workplace well-being and that the relationship is mediated by self-perceived employability. Stress moderates the relationship between serious leisure and self-perceived employability in such a way that the association is stronger when levels of stress are higher. Stress also moderates the mediating effect of self-perceived employability on the relationship between serious leisure and workplace well-being such that the indirect effect of serious leisure on workplace well-being is stronger when levels of stress are higher. Originality/value Theoretical implications come from drawing on leisure studies literature to differentiate casual leisure and serious leisure. The concept of serious leisure is subsequently integrated into the human resource management literature to explore the relationship between serious leisure, self-perceived employability, stress, and workplace well-being. Practical and policy implications suggest how universities and organisations can support their students and early careers talent by encouraging them to participate in serious leisure activities.",art

Purpose In this paper, the moderating roles of leader reward omission and person-supervisor fit in the relationship between job autonomy and knowledge hiding are investigated. Design/methodology/approach Using a sample of 248 employees in a two-wave survey, we performed a hierarchical regression analysis to test the hypotheses. Findings The results revealed that employees with high job autonomy were less likely to engage in knowledge hiding. Moreover, when employees experienced leader reward omission, the negative relationship between job autonomy and knowledge hiding was weakened, and this interesting effect varied by person-supervisor fit. Research limitations/implications This study does not explore the mediating mechanism by which job autonomy affects employee knowledge hiding. Moreover, as this research was conducted in a Chinese context, the generalizability of our findings is unclear. Practical implications This research has fulfilled its practical aims by providing advice on knowledge-relevant job characteristic factors that can be used to stage interventions regarding the provision of autonomy in jobs, and by carefully considering how to create interdependence between jobs without pushing people to engage in knowledge-hiding behaviors. Furthermore, it is important for leaders to help employees identify work goals and directions and not engage in reward omission. Originality/value This study contributes to theoretical advancements in the field of knowledge hiding by revealing boundary conditions that mitigate or enhance the impact of job autonomy on knowledge hiding.",art

Purpose The purpose of this case study is to test a moderated mediation model linking employees' perceived HRM practices to organizational citizenship behaviours (OCB) with perceived insider status as the mediator and emotional exhaustion as the moderator in a Chinese high-tech organization. Design/methodology/approach A sample of 417 Chinese employees were recruited from a large Chinese high-tech company to participate in a paper-and-pencil survey, and mediation and moderation were analysed using PROCESS macro for SPSS. Findings Perceived insider status partially mediates the relationship between perceived HRM practices and OCB, and emotional exhaustion moderates the relationship between perceived insider status and OCB such that the strength of the relationship is stronger in employees with low emotional exhaustion levels than in employees with high emotional exhaustion levels. Practical implications There is a need for organizations to promote the physical and psychological well-being of its employees in order to maximize the effectiveness of HRM practices. Originality/value This case study provides novel insights into how employees' perceived HRM practices elicit OCB and its boundary conditions in collectivistic cultures.",art

Purpose This study examines how the collective construction of career sustainability takes place through a career community of interim managers. Design/methodology/approach We draw on 31 interviews with interim managers who are part of a career community in the form of a professional association of interim managers in France. Findings The findings show the importance of career communities as a vehicle through which to create a sustainable career. More specifically, we show that occupational career communities provide mutual and reciprocal career support, collective being and belonging through sense-making as well as collective learning leading to the collective creation of a sustainable career. Originality/value We add to the literature on sustainable careers by providing a collective community-level analysis and make a theoretical contribution by using the concept of career communities in shedding light on the career sustainability of interim managers. In the light of the increase in non-standard forms of employment, career communities might become an interesting vehicle for career management and development.",art
10.1108/PR-07-2020-0563,"Freelance job search during times of uncertainty: protean career orientation, career competencies and job search. Purpose Freelancers are a growing population of working adults with limited to no organizational support. Yet, their strategies to navigate job search, especially in turbulent times, are unknown. To address this gap, the author hypothesized and examined a sequential mediation model whereby freelancer protean career orientation (PCO) influences job search strategies through career competencies (i.e. knowing why, how and with whom to work) and job search self-efficacy (JSSE). Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from a sample of 87 Canadian freelancers during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings The results supported the sequential mediation from PCO to job search strategies through two of the career competencies (knowing why and how) and JSSE. The mediating role of knowing whom was not supported. Practical implications Policy makers and learning institutions can provide freelancers with opportunities to develop transferable skills through massive open online courses (MOOCs). Employers of freelancers can design motivating jobs that provide freelancers with on-the-job learning and development opportunities. Social implications The insignificant mediating role of knowing whom (i.e. professional networks) implies that large networks might not be necessarily beneficial in times of crisis. Thus, the role of networks might be more complex than the literature has proposed. Originality/value This study brings into focus an overlooked population of workers: freelancers. It investigates a sequential mediation through which freelancer PCO impacts job search strategies. In addition, it compares the effectiveness of career competencies in unfolding the proposed sequential mediation.",art

Purpose This research unpacks the relationship between employees' perceptions of organizational injustice and their counterproductive work behaviour, by detailing a mediating role of organizational identification and a moderating role of discretionary human resource (HR) practices. Design/methodology/approach The hypotheses were tested with a sample of employees in Pakistan, collected over three, time-lagged waves. Findings An important reason that beliefs about unfair organizational treatment lead to enhanced counterproductive work behaviour is that employees identify less strongly with their employing organization. This mediating role of organizational identification is less salient, however, to the extent that employees can draw from high-quality, discretionary HR practices that promote their professional development and growth. Practical implications For management practitioners, this study pinpoints a key mechanism - the extent to which employees personally identify with their employer - by which beliefs about organizational favouritism can escalate into purposeful efforts to inflict harm on the organization and its members. It also reveals how this risk can be subdued by discretionary practices that actively support employees' careers. Originality/value This study adds to previous research by detailing why and when employees' frustrations about favouritism-based organizational decision making may backfire and elicit deviant responses that likely compromise their own organizational standing.",art
10.1108/PR-11-2023-0934,"Competitive strategy delivery in the service sector: a study of the behavioural model. PurposeOne of the most cited literature in SHRM is Schuler and Jackson's (1987) behavioural model. This model proposes that organisational performance is dependent on the extent to which HRM practices can be effectively connected to competitive strategy and desired employee behaviours. Importantly, this model recognises the salient role of employee behaviour in performance outcomes and, moreover that different competitive strategies imply both promulgation and reinforcement of different sets of employee skills and behaviours. Surprisingly, despite its significant influence on SHRM, studies rarely examine this model in its entirety. Motivated by the need to better understand this model's arguments in contemporary settings, our study uses a multi-actor design to explore the connections between competitive strategies (cost reduction and differentiation), employee behaviours, and HRM practices in service environments.Design/methodology/approachAdopting a multi-level, multi-actor survey design, our exploratory deductive study assesses the utility of strategic HRM's (SHRM) behavioural model. Drawing on data from a sample of service organisations and using univariate analyses, we compare operationalised HRM practices and employee behaviours across different strategy types.FindingsResults lend provisional support for the behavioural model, particularly in the case of a differentiation strategy where notable differences in HRM practices and employee behaviours were observed. Findings suggest growing levels of memetic and competitive isomorphism may be occurring, with this likely attributable to the increased incidence of idea generation and information sharing about best practices occurring amongst practitioners, as well as a growing nuance in operating markets, managerial preferences, employee expectations, stakeholder objectives, and the like.Research limitations/implicationsOur study suggests refinements to the behavioural model are needed. Some support for the model's key tenets is found, but these appear context specific. Thus, the merit in developing a priori typologies linking strategy type to HRM practices and employee behaviours where organisations operate in environments which are particularised and tumultuous appears debatable.Practical implicationsThis study highlights the behavioural model's nuance to modern service organisations and, by doing so, practitioners are provided with a behavioural pathway for achieving competitive advantage through their HRM practices. Findings also suggest that increasingly competitive environments might be encouraging practitioners to engage in isomorphic behaviours.Originality/valueThe use of a comparative research design allowed our study to contribute much needed empiricism to the largely conceptually informed stylised typologies depicting the linkages between different competitive strategies, implied employee role behaviours and HRM practices, thereby supporting the need for model refinement.",art

Purpose Existing research has ignored the perspectives of frontline managers (FLMs) in relation to the support they receive. This study aims to understand the extent to which and how other organisational actors support FLMs in their implementation of performance.Design/methodology/approach This article used a qualitative method (57 semi-structured interviews) in two Singapore public sector organisations to understand the types of support provided to FLMs. The interviewees came from various levels and the hierarchical sampling frame allowed for comparisons to be made across the cases.Findings The authors found that the HR department, superiors and peers signalled to FLMs the custom and practice of performance management (PM) that led to the FLMs not prioritising their PM responsibilities. Notably, the focus of the FLMs was on meeting operational needs rather than the PM process.Originality/value The authors add to the literature by examining the how the support from other organisational actors signalled to FLMs the importance of PM within their work group. This paper also explores how FLMs seek support and the type of support they want in their role.",art

PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to examine competence management practices in Brazilian industries using ISO 10015 as a framework of analysis, which establishes guidelines for competence management and people development.Design/methodology/approachA survey was conducted with 22 high-qualified human resources management (HRM) professionals (81.8% of participants hold a PhD) with extensive experience in the Brazilian industrial sector (an average of 20.4 years). The experts assessed 13 practices (P) elaborated based on the ISO 10015:2020, considering two categories: large industries (LI) and small and medium-sized industries (SMI). Data analysis was performed using Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, frequency analysis, Fuzzy TOPSIS and sensitivity analysis.FindingsThe practice individual competences are correctly defined by organizations at all hierarchical levels was deemed the best practice for LIs, while the practice clear definition of activities and their specificities when structuring competence management and people development programs was considered the best practice for SMIs. The practice organizations map employees' future competence and development needs on a regular basis received the lowest rating for both LIs and SMIs. When compared to LIs, SMIs have more severe deficiencies in applying competence management practices. The study's findings can be of great value in assisting managers in implementing structured competence management systems and people development initiatives.Practical implicationsThe findings of this study can be used by managers of businesses of all sizes and economic sectors to analyze their critical points in order to identify opportunities to improve their competence management systems and people development programs.Originality/valueThis study fills a knowledge gap by analyzing the adoption of competence management practices in Brazil, answering the call for HRM research in developing countries.

PurposeThe paper aims to investigate the dynamics of individuals' multiple commitments in the internship context by answering two questions: How do interns' commitment to different stakeholders change over time? And what are the reasons behind these changes?Design/methodology/approachA qualitative longitudinal study was conducted of a hundred and three interviews with twenty interns in three professional service firms in the UK. The data were gathered via semi-structured interviews that took place on five occasions during the whole internship.FindingsIndividuals' decision to maintain or change their commitment depended on their motive to gain long-term benefits (future employment) or short-term benefits (completing an assignment). Therefore, they experienced different types of commitment dynamics, which were influenced by their intention to commit to the organization in the future.Practical implicationsThis offers significant implications for attracting and employing interns, which directly affects talent employment. It also contributes to the contemporary work context, as the rise of temporary and cross-boundary settings would increase the complexity and dynamics of commitment.Originality/valueDespite the predominant assumption that considers commitment as a stable bond, this research is one of the first to investigate the dynamics of multiple commitments. This contributes to the commitment theory by identifying the different types of commitment dynamics and the impact of individuals' intention to commit on the (in)stability of their commitment, which is absent from the existing literature.",art
10.1108/PR-07-2022-0491,"From corporate social responsibility (CSR) to corporate humanistic responsibility (CHR): the conceptualization and operationalization of perceived CHR. PurposeOrganizations that prioritize humanistic responsibility create an environment of value for their employees as the most important stakeholders. However, despite the numerous corporate social responsibility (CSR) models and research highlighting stakeholder considerations, the long-standing social aspect of CSR has inhibited its humanism responsibility. In response, this study proposes to move beyond the antecedents and outcomes of CSR to explore how perceived CSR can promote its humanistic responsibility both inside and outside of organizations.Design/methodology/approachThe authors followed Sendjaya et al. (2008) 's methodology for developing and validating the perceived corporate humanistic responsibility (CHR) scale. Study 1 validated the CHR's content. Study 2 established the measure' reliability, internal consistency, unidimensionality and discriminant validity. The authors describe each of the studies in the forthcoming sections.FindingsThis research has produced a comprehensive set of perceived CHR items for business leaders based on earlier CHR/humanism concepts. Through the deconstruction of CHR theory, the granular conceptualization provides employee-centric workplaces, healthy internal communication, holistic compensation, CSR-committed behaviors and holistic training and development, equipped to assess how their CHR fosters humanistic workplaces that encourage socially responsible behaviors. This, in turn, would have an immense impact on employee well-being that, in turn, flourishes societal well-being.Research limitations/implicationsAlthough the perceived CHR scale's psychometric properties were confirmed using multiple tests ranging from qualitative to quantitative studies, this newly developed scale requires further investigation to explore whether internal or external relevance factors affect organizations' humanistic responsibility.Practical implicationsCSR is about caring for humans and the planet. The authors have unpacked what and how the human side of CSR operates for business leaders to advance their CHR practices and responsible management learning. The perceived CHR dimensions can guide business leaders to promote multidimensional humanistic behaviors inside and outside workplaces that transcend how to strengthen the humanistic responsibility behaviors of corporations to promote CHR by articulating how the Social aspect of CSR ought to function for employee well-being first.Social implicationsThis study responds to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) most aligned with the SDG 3 (good health and well-being) and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) by promoting humanistic workplaces with implications for United Nation's Principles for Responsible Management that encourages universities to educate students on humanism concepts in business management.Originality/valueThe originality lies in the empirical study of CHR. By incorporating the original concepts of humanism/humanistic management and CHR, the authors empirically articulate how CHR may be practically implemented as an elaborated humanistic synthesis for corporations.",art

Purpose The study maps workplace stakeholders' perceptions of living wage (LW) impacts in New Zealand. Empirical findings inform an inaugural model of LW impacts and contingent factors at individual, organisation, sector/industry and national levels. Design/methodology/approach Data from a national employee survey, semi-structured interviews with business sector representatives, and staff in two LW organisation cases were subjected to thematic content analysis. Findings Informants emphasised anticipated LW impacts amid complex workplace and regulatory dynamics. Employers/managers stressed its cost effects. However, employees, human resource (HR) advocates and other LW proponents highlighted employee investment impacts that improve worker productivity and societal circumstances. Research limitations/implications This study highlights the need for further context-sensitive LW analysis. An initial model of LW impacts provides a framework for comparative and longitudinal work in other national contexts. Practical implications The proposed model categorises perceived LW effects and can inform policy development. Findings also stress a need for cross-agency initiatives to address LW concerns, including a key role for HR. Social implications The findings highlight perceptions of a LW impacting within and beyond the workplace. Whilst higher-quality management is seen to encourage better-informed decisions about going living wage, a LW's positive socio-economic impacts require multi-lateral initiatives, suggesting that those initiatives are is part of wider obligations for policy makers to encourage decent living standards.

Purpose By integrating organizational support theory (OST) and social cognitive theory, this study investigates types of managers' coaching behavior as experienced by the employees. Furthermore, the study examines whether employees would exhibit greater task and contextual performance when organizational learning is blended with a specific coaching behavior of their manager. Design/methodology/approach Using primary data from 298 software engineers working in select information technology companies across India, the current study attempts to assess moderating effect of managers' coaching behavior in two relationships, including continuous learning and employees' task performance (CL-TP) and continuous learning and employees' contextual performance (CL-CP). Findings Result of exploratory factor analysis suggests that managers of select organizations exhibit two major types of coaching behavior: inspiration-based coaching behavior and facilitation-based coaching behavior. On the moderating role of coaching behavior, it is documented that facilitation-based coaching behavior significantly positively moderates both stated (CL-TP and CL-CP) relationships, whereas inspiration-based coaching behavior of supervisors has positive significant effect on CL-TP relationship but negatively moderates the CL-CP relationship. Research limitations/implications The extent to which the findings of this study can be generalized is constrained by the limited sample and organizational context. Practical implications The most important managerial implication for all learning organizations is that both kinds of coaching behaviors help improving the task performance of the employees, but managers should prefer facilitation-based coaching style in order to generate higher contextual performance of employees. Originality/value This study contributes to practitioners and existing literature by explaining how individual performance of employees is affected by the investment made by organizations in facilitating continuous learning.",art

Purpose The purpose of this research is to explore the effect of proactivity on work-family enrichment through thriving at work and the moderation of such mediation by immediate supervisor perspective-taking. Design/methodology/approach Research data consisting of two-wave lagged data (N = 470) were collected from 470 employees of 17 domestic Chinese firms to examine the proposed moderated mediation model. Findings The findings show that proactivity was positively related to work-family enrichment and that thriving at work partially mediated this relationship. Immediate supervisor perspective-taking strengthens the effect of proactivity on thriving at work, and a positive indirect relationship exists between proactivity and work-family enrichment through thriving at work when immediate supervisor perspective-taking is high. Practical implications Organizations should formulate policies to motivate employees to engage in proactive behavior and stimulate employees' thriving at work. Organizations should also select leaders who are good at perspective-taking and provide training to leaders to help them take others' perspectives. Originality/value These results deepen our theoretical understanding of the consequences of proactivity by demonstrating the positive associations between proactive behavior and work-family enrichment. The current study also contributes to the literature by identifying the mediating mechanism of thriving at work to explain the relationship between proactivity and work-family enrichment.

Purpose The aim of this paper is to move away from the focus upon the drivers of diversity to consider the drivers of inclusion in the workplace. The research outlined addresses this by considering the views of all employees, not just those who would be considered members of minority groups. Design/methodology/approach The paper draws on an extensive set of case study data from a range of methodological sources. The case study is of a major high street retailer. Findings Findings focus upon what leads to employees feeling included in the workplace. In addressing this we explore both the drivers of, and barriers to, inclusion. We argue that inclusion is complex and that individuals may feel included by some aspects of organisational culture whilst simultaneously feeling excluded by others. Practical implications The implications of our results for HR practitioners are that organisations need to pay attention to general HR policies as ways of enhancing inclusion, for example development practices, but also pay attention to the different needs of diverse groups. Originality/value The paper is original in that in recognising that equality, diversity and inclusion are all closely related, we demonstrate that an understanding of the effectiveness of diversity strategies needs to be fundamentally informed by a consideration of inclusion which can only occur through an engagement with employee's understandings of organisational culture and their place or otherwise within it. Without this employee engagement, many well-intentioned diversity initiatives may go awry. Moreover, the value of the research is that it demonstrates that in order to be successful an inclusion strategy needs to embrace both minority and majority perspectives.",art
10.1002/hrm.22218,"Managerial control or feedback provision: How perceptions of algorithmic HR systems shape employee motivation, behavior, and well-being. Algorithmic HR systems are becoming a more prevalent interface between organizations and employees. Yet little research has examined how automated HR processes impact employee motivation. In a three-wave study (N-Time1 = 401; N-Time2 = 379; N-Time3 = 303), we investigated the motivational effects of HR systems that automatically capture-and make decisions based on-employee performance, and whether these effects depend on employee attributions regarding the organization's intended use of its automated HR metric system. Additionally, we test whether these motivational states affect employee task prioritization and emotional exhaustion. Results show that employees whose organizations use algorithmic HR systems, and who also attribute managerial control as intent to that system, experience higher levels of extrinsic motivation at work. This, in turn, predicts greater prioritization of metricized tasks and de-prioritization of non-metricized tasks. Conversely, employees who believe the purpose of algorithmic HR systems is to provide them with constructive feedback are more likely to experience intrinsic motivation, leading to reduced feelings of emotional exhaustion, greater prioritization of metricized tasks, but reduced non-metricized behavior de-prioritization. These results illustrate the critical importance of employee sensemaking around algorithmic HR systems as a precursor to the impact of such systems on employee motivation, behavior, and well-being.",art
10.1002/hrm.22131,"A social network perspective on workplace inclusion: The role of network closure, network centrality, and need for affiliation. Organizations are increasingly recognizing the important role employee inclusion perceptions play in promoting positive employee attitudes and behaviors. Although social networks are frequently cited as being a driver of perceived inclusion, little empirical work has examined the social network conditions that give rise to it. We address this gap by examining how both network position (indegree centrality) and network structure (network closure) relate to perceived workplace inclusion. We test our hypotheses with a sample of 364 professionals in a multinational pharmaceutical firm. We find that both indegree centrality and network closure are positively related to perceived workplace inclusion. The relationship between network centrality and perceived workplace inclusion is strengthened by a high level of network closure. In addition, the relationship between network closure and perceived workplace inclusion is strengthened by a high level of need for affiliation. Our results, therefore, suggest that both network centrality and closure play an important role in employee perceptions of inclusion and demonstrate the importance of considering need for affiliation as a boundary condition. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for theory and practice.",art
10.1002/hrm.22089,"Recruitment brand equity for unknown employers: Examining the effects of recruitment message claim verifiability and credibility on job pursuit intentions. Prior research on recruitment and employer brand equity has primarily drawn on the cognitive psychology perspective from the marketing brand equity literature to examine how recruitment practices and job seekers' perceptions of employer brand image impact recruitment outcomes. This perspective, however, provides little guidance for how unknown organizations can use recruitment messages to influence job seekers. Our study draws from research on the search-experience framework, which uses an information economics approach to brand equity, to identify how recruitment claims from companies with no employer brand image shape job seekers' job pursuit intentions. Results based on a within-subjects study with 197 participants showed that job seekers perceive differences in claim verifiability depending on the job or company attribute in the message. Further, we found that job seekers' perceptions of recruitment claim verifiability are indirectly related to intentions to pursue the recruiting organization through perceived claim credibility. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.",art

Working in social care is fraught with challenges fueled by changing policies, funding structures, societal expectations, and high relational demands, leaving employees in this sector particularly vulnerable to poor well-being. In this study, we focus on the importance of a supportive work context-specifically coworker instrumental support and leaders' role clarity-in enabling employee role clarity, and how this can foster better mental health and reduce fatigue from ongoing changes in the sector. We ran a multilevel moderated mediation model on a sample of 270 social care employees matched with 47 leaders across two disability care organizations in Australia. Results showed that coworker instrumental support promotes role clarity, which in turn is associated with lower psychological distress and change fatigue, and higher job satisfaction. The positive relationship between coworker instrumental support and role clarity, and the subsequent relationships with well-being, were stronger when employees had leaders who themselves had role clarity. Our findings highlight the importance of a supportive work context and role clarity as malleable levers in enabling a sustainable social care workforce and provide new theoretical and practical insights for human resource management in the social care sector.",art

Even though, the human resource management literature has highlighted the importance of having employees that are committed to the organization, research on strategic human capital has yet to fully consider how commitment is related to human capital resources. In order to overcome the dominant individual-level conceptualization of commitment and to detail how commitment affects human capital resources, we develop the unit-level concept of commitment capital, which we divide into three levels: affiliative commitment capital, affinitive commitment capital, and absolute commitment capital. These conceptualizations are based on a 10-year case study and incorporate commitment into a strategic human capital framework, thus bridging the current gap between organizational commitment and human capital resources.",art
10.1002/hrm.22240,"Identifying forms of after-hours information communication technology use and their role in psychological detachment: An episodic approach. Employees increasingly conduct work outside of traditional work hours via information communication technologies (ICTs). There is a need to understand how after-hours ICT use relates to well-being, given that such connectivity has become unavoidable. We implement an episodic, event-contingent design to evaluate the association between different ICT media (i.e., e-mail, phone call, chat app, short message service) and the within-person outcomes of psychological detachment as partially mediated by task productivity. A daily diary survey was collected over three consecutive workdays to capture after-hours ICT use. Daily surveys were completed by 498 individuals, with a total of 1494 episodes being captured of after-hours work ICT engagement. Our results indicate that while engagement with any form of ICT after hours reduces psychological detachment, email and chat apps are associated with the lowest levels of psychological detachment. Moreover, whereas the use of asynchronous ICT has positive main effects on episode-related task productivity, the use of synchronous ICT (e.g., phone) only enhances episode-related task productivity when there are high organizational expectations for employees' responsiveness after hours.",art

Research findings concerning the effects of perceived overqualification on task performance are mixed. To reconcile the disparate findings, drawing on person-environment theory, we propose cynicism toward the job and constructive deviance as contrasting dual pathways that explain the negative and positive effects of perceived overqualification on task performance and employee creativity. We also examine the moderating effects of dual-focused transformational leadership (TFL) on the relationships between perceived overqualification and the two mediating mechanisms. We test this model using data collected from 469 employees and their 135 supervisors via two-wave surveys. The results support the negative and positive mediating mechanisms. In addition, based on one field study and two online experiments, we find that individual-focused TFL mitigates the relationship between perceived overqualification and cynicism toward the job, but that team-focused TFL enhances the relationship between perceived overqualification and constructive deviance.",art

Despite increasing interest in supporting older workers' motivation, retention, and well-being at work, knowledge about how social networks at work may affect the efficacy of training interventions among older employees is scarce. These social ties are an important source of resources for older workers' careers. This study examined the characteristics of older workers' personal social networks as boundary conditions for the effects of late-career management intervention on work engagement. Data were used from an earlier randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which senior employees (mean age of 58 years) participated in a peer group-based training intervention and were asked to complete follow-up surveys at baseline, post-intervention, and after 6 months (Vuori et al., 2019, Journal of Vocational Behavior, 115: 103327). The results showed that older workers' social ties at higher organizational levels (upper reachability) and the number of social ties at work moderated the effect of the intervention on work engagement. Specifically, the intervention aimed at enhancing employees' personal resources improved work engagement for senior employees with few or no social ties at work with whom they could discuss important matters, and for those with social ties at higher organizational levels. However, the relationship quality between older workers and their leaders showed no moderation effect. This study encourages human resources professionals to consider the social network characteristics and peer learning of older workers when providing training to enhance their work engagement.",art
10.1002/hrm.22182,"Too smart to work hard? Investigating why overqualified employees engage in time theft behaviors. Integrating the theory of workplace deviance with person-environment fit theory, we propose a two-pathway model to explain why and how employees who feel overqualified engage in time theft behavior. Specifically, we anticipate that feeling overqualified will negatively influence focal employees' experienced authority fairness and erode their work meaningfulness, which in turn will lead to increased time theft behavior. Further, we argue that voice endorsement serves as a key boundary condition mitigating the negative effects of perceived overqualification. We conducted two multi-waved and multi-sourced field studies to test our proposed hypotheses. Study 1 (247 employees and 47 supervisors) revealed that perceived overqualification is associated with time theft behavior through the mediators of experienced authority fairness and meaningfulness. Study 2 (405 employees and 73 supervisors) replicated the findings of Study 1 and tested our full model. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.",art
10.1002/hrm.22106,"The curvilinear effect of perceived overqualification on constructive voice: The moderating role of leader consultation and the mediating role of work engagement. Drawing on the social cognitive theory of self-regulation, we proposed a model considering an inverted U-shaped relationship between perceived overqualification and constructive voice. We reasoned from the theory that this curvilinear effect would be moderated by leader consultation, which could intensify the upward curvilinear trend and neutralize the downward curvilinear trend, and be mediated by work engagement. We conducted two studies to test our model. In Study 1, based on a three-wave time-lagged sample of 293 employees and 120 supervisors, we found an inverted U-shaped relationship between perceived overqualification and constructive voice, which was moderated by leader consultation. In Study 2, we examined the proposed mediated moderation model using a sample of 231 matched leader-subordinate dyads. We found that, at lower levels, perceived overqualification has a positive association with constructive voice, which is mediated by work engagement, especially at higher leader consultation. At higher levels, perceived overqualification has a negative association with work engagement and thus constructive voice, especially at lower levels of leader consultation. The implications of our research are discussed.",art
10.1002/hrm.22097,"Pre-crisis commitment human resource management and employees' attitudes in a global pandemic: The role of trust in the government. Studies of human resource management (HRM) have produced plentiful results on commitment HRM, but its effects during a crisis have rarely been examined. Incorporating the commitment HRM view and the cognitive phenomenological framework, we examined whether and how commitment HRM practices implemented prior to the COVID-19 mitigate employees' negative cognitive evaluations and attitudes during the pandemic. Moreover, a pandemic is a situation that requires strong government interventions, and we further examined whether employees' trust in the government would play a moderating role in explaining the effects of commitment HRM. With a multilevel framework, we measured commitment HRM via an analysis of big data provided online prior to the pandemic and matched the information to employees' responses collected from a survey after the outbreak of the pandemic. With data from 1010 employees and 52 companies, we found that employees in organizations with a higher utilization of commitment HRM showed less threat appraisals. Moreover, those experiencing fewer threat appraisals showed more commitment to their organizations. In addition, we found that the negative link between a company's commitment HRM and its employees' threat appraisals was pronounced when they had a lower level of trust in the government. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",art

Information on a company's employment webpage sends signals about the employer image the company intends to project to applicants. Nonetheless, we know little about the content of recruitment signals sent via company employment webpages. This study develops a method to measure companies' projected employer image attributes based on their employment webpages. Specifically, we analyze companies' projected employer image attributes by applying computer-aided text analysis (CATA) to the employment webpages of 461 Fortune 500 companies (i.e., more than 11,100 individual pages). Our results show that projected employer image attributes remain relatively stable over time. Moreover, we find relatively low levels of employer image differentiation between companies and between industries. Only a small group of companies (<20%) use distinct employer attribute signals to communicate their projected employer image. Finally, there is limited convergence between projected employer image attributes based on employment webpages and ratings on similar attributes on employer review websites. Generally, our results show that CATA is a viable method for assessing companies' projected employer image in the context of employer image management and engineering.",art
10.1002/hrm.22080,"Performance management systems and multinational enterprises: Where we are and where we should go. In this comprehensive summary, we take a critical look at the state of performance management systems in multinational enterprises, summarizing what we have learned to this point, and speculating on where the field should go. We specifically address four challenges (i) can performance really be managed? (ii) if so, how do we go about doing this? (iii) the need to balance consistency across locations with the need to accommodate unique realities of individual locations, and (iv) addressing the different employee profiles - i.e., expatriates vs. host country nationals. In terms of what we have learned to this point, we believe that global organizations need to pay more attention to (i) performance context, (ii) ratee reactions, and (iii) rater motivation, as these are integral to successful performance management. On the other hand, they might re-consider and re-visit the amount of time and energy spent on factors such as (i) appraisal forms and (ii) rater training, as these may not be serving any useful purpose. We next discuss the unique challenges faced by multinational enterprises, including (i) the type of strategy a corporation might employ (Bartlett & Ghoshal, 1998), (ii) the different cultures of the nations where the organization operates (Hofstede et al., 2010), and (iii) managing the performance of expatriates (Toh & DeNisi, 2007). Looking ahead, we would like to remind multinational corporations (and all other corporations) that culture and context matter, but these must be addressed in concert with the need to treat all employees fairly and consistently. We conclude by proposing several research ideas, including the need to explore the potential role of host country nationals in the performance management process for multinational enterprises.",art
10.1002/hrm.22056,"Home and host distal context and performance appraisal in multinational enterprises: A 22 country study. Context is a central construct in the study of performance appraisal (PA) systems, but to date studies linking the distal context within which organizations operate to PA have been limited in two ways. First, these studies have focused predominantly on national culture, and have paid less attention to the legal/political and economic environment within which organizations. Second, few studies reflect the growing international nature of business organizations, which create multiple layers of context (e.g., home and host country context). Drawing on both situational strength and institutional theories, we hypothesize the links between the big three facets of distal context (i.e., culture, legal/political, and economic) and the processes and purposes of PA systems. Using data from 472 multinational enterprises (MNEs) in 22 countries, we show that all three facets of the distal context of the host country influence decisions about the conduct of PA systems. In addition, we show that the culture and legal/political systems of the home country from which the MNE originated are also linked to the PA processes and purposes. Finally, we find evidence that MNEs are more likely to develop hybridized PA systems that depart from host country norms.",art
10.1002/hrm.22227,"Exploring representations of human resource management as moral dirty work: A film study. It has been claimed that the HR profession suffers from a chronic shortage of social legitimacy. In this article, we advance the idea that HR is also to some extent subject to public stigmatization for being immoral. In other words, we maintain that certain aspects of contemporary HR work can be conceptualized as morally dirty work. We provide empirical support for this contention by analyzing a set of 28 films portraying HR practitioners at work. The research results comprise both task-related and method-related filmic representations of HR work as immoral, thus furnishing a comprehensive and nuanced picture of the moral issues that can affect the HR profession. Furthermore, the results show that some of the HR characters analyzed-typically those who hold a role as (co-)protagonists in the story-realize the immorality affecting their work and decide to distance themselves from it by either exiting the role, trying to reform it, or openly raising resistance against their employer. These research results suggest the need to integrate dirty work scholarship into study of the HR profession, while they provide important indications in terms of future HR research, practice and education.",art
10.1002/hrm.22191,"Delayed pay and employee turnover: The buffering role of pay-for-performance. In response to a financial crisis, many organizations adjust their pay systems to reduce labor costs. In this research, we focus on the use of delayed pay (the postponement of employees' contractual compensation) and examine its effect on employee voluntary turnover outcomes. In a field study (Study 1) with data collected from the executive managers of 129 Chinese hotels experiencing a financial crisis caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we find a positive relationship between delayed pay and the voluntary turnover rate at the organizational level. In addition, this relationship becomes weaker when delayed pay consists of a larger proportion of pay-for-performance (PFP). We then conduct an experiment (Study 2) to extend our theoretical framework to the individual level, establish causality, and examine the underlying mechanism. The results show that the perceived negative instrumentality of stay (i.e., expected economic losses associated with staying in an organization) explains why individuals intend to leave organizations adopting delayed base pay but not delayed PFP. We further replicate these findings in a critical incident technique study (Study 3). We also discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.",art
10.1002/hrm.22184,"How the human resource (HR) function adds strategic value: A relational perspective of the HR function. In the present article, we propose the concept of the HR function's relational activities and examine its influence on the firm's human capital resources (HCRs) and performance. Integrating insights from various streams of research in strategic human resource management (HRM) and strategic human capital, we develop a relational perspective of the HR function and propose the relational activities as the HR function's advisory and informative activities toward its internal stakeholders (i.e., line managers, employees, and senior managers) to help the stakeholders meet their goals and needs. In our framework, we theorize how the HR function's relational activities lead to superior firm performance by enhancing the firm's HCRs and identify the firm's strategic HR systems and human capital losses as factors that complement and necessitate the HR function's relational activities, respectively. Using a five-wave, nationally representative panel dataset covering 1415 firm observations, we find robust support for our hypotheses: the HR function's relational activities were positively related to HCRs, which was more pronounced when coupled with high levels of strategic HR systems and human capital losses. The HCRs, in turn, transmitted the effects of the relational activities on the firm's subsequent operational and financial performance. Overall, these findings develop strategic HRM theory by contributing a more comprehensive conceptualization of the HR function's role in the strategic HRM process and by revealing its effects on firm performance along with key moderators.",art
10.1002/hrm.22163,"Looking up and fitting in: Team leaders' and members' behaviors and attitudes toward the environment in an MNC. As an emerging topic in human resource management (HRM) research, organizational citizenship behavior for the environment (OCBE) and workgroup green advocacy (WGGA) have been studied as a proxy of the environmental performance of organizations as well as a potential way for companies to assess the impact of their environmental strategies and initiatives. Viewing OCBE and WGGA as green-focused knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics and building on leader-member exchange theory, we examined the effects of leaders' OCBE and WGGA, person-supervisor fit (PSF), and person-group fit (PGF) as well as their potential interactions on members' OCBE and WGGA. To minimize the potential impact of different company strategies, the study was conducted in one MNC using a sample of 269 members from 64 teams. The results revealed that PSF and especially PGF were associated with members' OCBE and WGGA, but leaders' OCBE was a stronger predictor of members' OCBE and WGGA than leaders' WGGA. Contrary to our prediction, no moderating effect of PSF or PGF was found for the associations between leaders' and members' WGGA and OCBE. Together, these findings shed light on the differential trickle-down effects of leaders' perceptions and behaviors in the context of environmental management. As for the implications for HRM practitioners, our findings suggest companies may focus on leaders' OCBE and WGGA as well as on PSF and PGF independently as the means to shaping team members' OCBE and WGGA to support environmental strategies.",art

The relationship between extrinsic rewards and creativity has been subject to ongoing debate within the human resource management and creativity literatures. More research on the mechanisms and boundary conditions has been called for. In this study, using 187 employee-supervisor dyads in an electronics manufacturing company, we investigated how and when creativity-contingent extrinsic rewards (CER) may foster creativity among manufacturing employees. Drawing on self-determination theory, we hypothesized, and found that employee intrinsic motivation mediated the relationship between CER and employee creativity. This relationship was the strongest when employees rated their leader-member exchange (LMX) as high. The findings reveal the important role of CER in guiding manufacturing employees' intrinsic motivation and stimulating creativity. The identification of LMX as a moderator uncovers crucial boundary conditions of this relationship. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",art

Promotions, as a part of organizational incentive and reward systems, can motivate employees to perform well and to increase commitment to their firms. But very little is known about why and when promotion failure influences employees' subsequent responses. Integrating social-cognitive theory and the cognitive appraisal theory of emotion in justice literature, we investigated the effect of promotion failure on employees' work engagement through cognitive and emotional processes and the moderating effects of perceived promotion fairness. Employing two survey studies (Study 1 and Study 2) and an experimental study (Study 3), we found that: (1) promotion failure was negatively related to self-efficacy and positively associated with anger; (2) promotion failure was negatively related to work engagement through reduced self-efficacy and elevated anger; (3) promotion perceived to be fair amplified the negative effect of promotion failure on employee self-efficacy but mitigated its influence on anger; (4) promotion fairness perception strengthened the indirect negative relationship between promotion failure and work engagement through self-efficacy but weakened this indirect relationship via anger. Our work contributes to promotion and justice literature and enlightens practitioners about how to manage promotion practice.",art

The topic of green human resource management (HRM) has drawn increasing attention of HRM scholars in the past decade. Recent research has called for more studies to identify the antecedents of green HRM used in organizations and explore the mediating mechanisms through which green HRM is related to performance outcomes. This study represents an effort to address these research needs by examining the joint effects of chief executive officer (CEO) environmental belief and external pollution severity on the use of green HRM and testing the mediating role of employee environmental commitment in the relationship between green HRM and firm performance. Drawing upon data collected from multiple sources (i.e., survey data from chief executive officer (CEOs), chief financial officers (CFOs), HR managers and employees, and archival data from government statistics), we found that CEO's environmental belief is significantly related to the use of green HRM, especially for companies operating in locations with severer pollution. Green HRM in turn has a positive relationship with the firm's environmental and financial performances via employee commitment to the environment. The findings highlight the often-overlooked role of in the strategic HRM literature pertinent to environmental management and clarify the antecedents and influential mechanisms of green HRM at the firm level of analysis. We also discuss theoretical and practical implications in this study.",art

This article reviews discrimination and diversity research published in Human Resource Management (HRM) over the past 60 years. While discrimination and diversity are very different constructs, it is often informative to study them together, because when people recognize each other's diversity, this can result in bias, stereotyping, and discrimination. We conducted bibliographic searches for terms related to discrimination and diversity as well as a manual search through every title and abstract published in HRM over the last 60 years to assess article relevance. The search resulted in 135 research articles with 136 unique studies (i.e., samples) which are reviewed in this article. Sex and race are the demographics that have been examined the most in HRM, while religion has been examined the least. Moreover, the number of studies examining lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) employees in the workplace in HRM has grown quickly within the past 10 years, culminating in a recent meta-analysis. Our review looks at some of the earliest research published, the most recent research published, and the overall trends we identified in the research over the years for both discrimination and diversity articles. We then make future research suggestions and recommendations to advance the study of discrimination and diversity in the coming years.",art

We examine differences in jobs held by men and women based on a measure not used before, the standard human resources measures of knowledge, skills, and abilities generated by job analyses. While there is an abundance of evidence on gender disparities in pay, we know much less in detail about differences in the work men and women perform and especially how these differences have changed over time. We use nationally representative data for two cohorts of college graduates, one entering the post-college workforce in 1994 and another in 2009, and we follow them for the first 10 years of their careers. We find that women generally held jobs with lower requirements relative to men. The gender gap in job requirements grew over the course of individuals' careers for the first cohort (1994-2003) but declined sharply for the second (2009-2018). We also find that among the second cohort, women received a wage premium for social skills that was greater than what men received.",art

Amidst the decline of permanent employment contracts and the rapid shortening of career cycles, organizations often face challenges in fully capitalizing on employee mobility. This study adopts a multilevel perspective to explore how mobility impacts both individual and team performance, focusing on acquiring colleague-specific human capital through two talent acquisition strategies: boomerang hiring and pipeline-based hiring. Using a unique Major League Baseball database spanning 41 years, including 19,927 player-year records and 1156 team-year records, our analysis reveals that individuals engaged in boomerang and pipeline-based hiring and possessing higher levels of individual colleague-specific human capital, experience greater benefits from mobility in terms of individual performance. Moreover, these hiring strategies allow organizations to effectively harness colleague-specific human capital. Specifically, team performance is positively influenced by a greater proportion of boomerang hiring through team colleague-specific human capital resources. Similarly, a higher ratio of pipeline-based hiring, alongside other recurrent hiring practices, positively impacts team performance through team colleague-specific human capital resources. Our findings provide valuable insights for organizations aiming to rejuvenate their colleague-specific human capital resources through strategic hiring practices to achieve sustained success.",art
10.1002/hrm.22247,"Bridges and gatekeepers: Employees' willingness to refer qualified candidates on the autism spectrum. Recruiting neurodiverse talent has increasingly featured on the organizational diversity agenda, yet recruitment practices geared toward locating and attracting neurodivergent candidates remain understudied. While research and practice have shown that employee referral is one of the channels through which a significant part of new talent is recruited, little is known about employees' willingness to refer qualified social contacts who are neurodivergent. We address this limitation by investigating employees' willingness to refer highly qualified candidates on the autism spectrum and some conditions under which they are more or less likely to refer such candidates. We explore these aspects in a study of working individuals, using a mixed-method approach. The quantitative analysis shows that disclosure of an autism condition to potential referrers might pose some advantage, in that it increases the likelihood of being referred, but this advantage accrues only to male candidates. Furthermore, cues that hint at the social dimension of the ideal worker, commonly used in job recruitment materials, are the strongest deterrent for referrers. The qualitative analysis of the reasons behind decisions to refer sheds light on some mechanisms that might explain these findings.",art

Are there factors that moderate these emotions and their harmful implications? Relying on the affective events theory, the current study investigated these questions using a moderated mediation model in which: (a) perceived managerial supplication elicited sadness that resulted in counterproductive work behavior and (b) political skill and emotional intelligence moderated these relationships.Design/methodology/approachThe moderated mediation model was tested using a sample of 167 employees. The data were collected in three waves.FindingsPerceived managerial supplication was positively related to subordinates' sadness and both dimensions of counterproductive work behavior, namely, organizational and interpersonal counterproductive work behavior.

10.1108/PR-09-2022-0629,"Training under an extreme context: the role of organizational support and adaptability on the motivation transfer and performance after training. PurposeThe present study used the job-demands and resources (JD-R) framework to understand how the training is transferred to an extreme working context through the analysis of job and personal resources (social support from the leader and colleagues and adaptability). Specifically, the authors tested the mediating role of motivation to transfer in the relationship (1) between the perceived support from the supervisor and colleagues and performance after training and (2) between adaptability and performance in an extreme context of the pandemic crisis - the first peak of COVID-19 in Portugal. Further, an inspection of the factors that predicted knowledge transfer and adaptability under an extreme context was carried out.Design/methodology/approachTo do so, necessary training about the new safety rules regarding the pandemic crisis of COVID-19 was implemented in a healthcare institution as a strategy to help healthcare workers deal with the increasing uncertainty and complexity that was threatening their work. It consisted of three sessions (each with one hour of training) regarding procedures, rules and safety norms. The training occurred in May 2020. Overall, 291 healthcare workers participated in the study and answered one online questionnaire one week after training completion.FindingsThe results showed that the motivation to transfer had a significant indirect effect on the relationship between colleagues' and supervisors' support and performance and between adaptability and performance. Additionally, complementary analyses showed that the mediations depended on the levels of self-efficacy in such a way that the indirect relationships were stronger when self-efficacy was higher. Thus, adaptability and support, both from colleagues and the supervisor, are determining factors for knowledge transfer and resultant performance in extreme contexts, such as the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Lastly, the results showed that the most significant predictors of transference were self-efficacy and the motivation to transfer the learned knowledge. On the other hand, self-efficacy, peer support and the opportunity to use the knowledge were the most significant predictors of adaptability.Practical implicationsThese findings provide support for the role of employee motivation to transfer as a mechanism connecting both perceived support and adaptability to performance outcomes under extreme working contexts.Originality/valueThis study, conducted in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic context - an extreme and uncertain working context - shows the relevance of both job and individual factors to predict employees' adaptability to such contexts.",art

PurposeThis study aims to investigate the direct effect of organizational reputation (OR), employer brand (EB) and organizational attributes (OA) on the intention to apply for a job vacancy (IAJV); further, it examined the mediating effect of employer brand in the OA-IAJV relationship while taking into consideration the moderating effect of organizational reputation.Design/methodology/approachA mixed-method approach was employed, with ten in-depth interviews followed by a questionnaire with additional 356 job seekers in Cairo and Giza cities; the sample includes both fresh graduates and experienced job applicants in the job market. The qualitative analysis confirmed that some respondents use organizational reputation as a signal of its performance. The path analysis technique tests the research hypotheses using a partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM).FindingsThe findings revealed that the most influential variable in the intention to apply is organizational attributes, followed by organizational reputation and finally employer brand. There is a significant relationship between organizational attributes and intention to apply for a job vacancy via employer brand. In addition, the results indicate a noteworthy moderating impact of organizational reputation on the association between employer brand intentions to apply for a job and the relationship between organizational attributes and intention to apply for a job opening.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this study contributes to the understanding of the direct and indirect effects of organizational reputation and organizational attributes on intention to apply through the mediating role of the employer brand. This research opens new avenues for recruitment research, considering the moderating effect of organizational reputation on strengthening the impact of the independent variables on the intention to apply and the interaction between the variables affecting the intention. Further, this study focuses on the needs of the job applicants when perceiving the organizational factors and identifies which signals can generate the intention to apply according to the signaling theory.",art

PurposeThe study aims to investigate the impact of workplace ostracism (WO) and fear of the COVID-19 pandemic on the family life of restaurant employees. This research is based on the conservation of resources (COR) theory and work-family interface model to understand the theoretical underpinnings of mistreatment in the food sector during the COVID-19 pandemic.Design/methodology/approachThe study utilized a survey with a structured questionnaire to collect time-lagged data from 238 restaurant employees in the central region of Punjab province in Pakistan. The collected data were analyzed using the SPSS tool with modern-day techniques like bootstrapping, process macro and SmartPLS.FindingsThe study reveals that perceived stress levels of the employees increase due to ostracism, leading to work-family conflict. Furthermore, the study found that employees who fear COVID-19 are less stressed by ostracism.Originality/valueThe study's significant contribution lies in demonstrating that the impact of ostracism in the workplace is quite different from what was expected. The results have shown that ostracism can reduce the perceived stress levels of employees, leading to a decrease in work-family conflict, especially in the presence of fear of COVID-19.",art

PurposeBuilding on the premise of conservation of resources theory (COR) that people protect their knowledge as a resource, the authors questioned whether the contextual nature of job resources buffers the counterintuitive positive relationship between evasive knowledge hiding (KH) and task performance.Design/methodology/approachTwo multisource field survey studies were conducted to examine the moderating influence of task-job resources on the knowledge hiders' task performance. Hierarchical regression analyses tested the main effect of evasive KH on task performance. In addition, conditional process analyses were applied to examine two-way and three-way interactions of evasive KH, job autonomy and task variety.FindingsThe data analysis showed a positive relationship between evasive KH and task performance. Moreover, the authors found that employees receiving accumulative task-job resources continued to hide knowledge and used abundant resources to increase their task performance further. However, contrary to expectations, for employees-who received partial task-job resources-their task performance deteriorated when evasively hiding knowledge.Practical implicationsManagers and human resource practitioners should acknowledge that employees' evasive KH to co-workers is not always wrong and should not be treated like it is. Moreover, they are endorsed to pay attention and invest in job resources since job autonomy and task variety create a beneficial context for knowledge holders' task performance.Originality/valueThe authors provided novel theoretical (the gain-loss perspective of COR theory) and consistent empirical (confirmed by two field-study evidence) arguments for an important contextual role of an HRM practice of job design in shaping the underrepresented knowledge behavior-task performance relationship.",art

Purpose This study clarifies how intra-organizational social capital (IOSC) and unit-organizational ambidexterity (UOA), using resource-based view and dynamic capability theory, together support organizational value creation. While there is research in strategic human resource management (SHRM) exploring the role of resources and its uses, there remains limited understanding of how resources are linked and their effective utilization in the service sector. This study aims to examine the mediating process linking employee-experienced service-oriented high-performance work systems (SHPWS) experienced by employees and service performance by integrating IOSC and UOA. Design/methodology/approach This study uses time lagged data from managers and employees of different branches of Chinese state-owned banks. To test the proposed hypotheses, path analysis was applied. Findings The path analysis results reveal that employee-experienced SHPWS is an important antecedent of service performance. Moreover, IOSC (as resources) and UOA (uses) strongly mediate the theorized relationship. Originality/value This study attempts to refine theory and practice with clearer, more insightful and coherent means to better understand and help unpack the 'black box' between SHPWS-performance relationships through a new linkage model.",art

Purpose The goal of this study is to explore the consequences of flexibility i-deals in work and non-work domains of employees. Design/methodology/approach A matched supervisor-subordinate sample context drawn from a security organization in Chile (N = 3,624 subordinates matched with 107 supervisors) was used which is an unrepresented context in research on i-deals. Findings Results from multi-level analyses reveal that the interaction of performance motivation of subordinates and flexibility i-deals matters to performance motivation of subordinates. In turn, performance motivation reduces turnover intentions and work-family conflict of subordinates. Research limitations/implications The findings from multi-level structural equation modelling supported our hypotheses and offered interesting implications for the i-deals literature and practitioners. Our findings highlight (1) the importance of being performance driven to obtain flexibility i-deals and (2) the enabling role of performance-oriented supervisors. Practical implications Flexibility i-deals act as mechanism that translate the impact of performance motivation on key work and non-work outcomes and can be considered as important HR tools for employees and managers. Originality/value This research highlights the importance of performance motivation to obtain i-deals and emphasises that the motivation of supervisors is key to enable these deals.

Purpose In the context of an aging workforce and uncertain labor markets, it is a priority to identify and analyze what factors influence intentions regarding motivation to continue working, how and when to retire. From the life course perspective, this paper aims to capture the individual agency and structure perceptions to withdrawal from work early/late intentions in the mid- and late-career, identifying voluntary/involuntary factors underlying these intentions. Design/methodology/approach Hypotheses were tested using multiple regression analyses based on a cross-sectional design, with a representative sample of 414 Chilean workers over the age of 45. Findings The results depict several patterns of contextual factors operating at different levels underlying mid- and late-career-related intentions. Specifically, they identify how perceptions of individual agency and structure are significantly associated with voluntary and involuntary factors that guide intentions to stay working or retire early, as well as to prolong working life and to lean toward bridge employment. Originality/value This study contributes to identifying perceptions of individual agency and structure in career intentions and can help individuals and organizations clarify the voluntary and involuntary factors behind work-life intentions in their middle and final career stages. In addition, the results can contribute to international research in this field by providing information on the underrepresented Ibero-American context.",art

Purpose Despite an evident increase in the number of women joining Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) majors at universities, the recruitment and retainment of women in STEM occupations continue to be a substantial challenge. The aim of this research is to investigate several individual and contextual factors that could increase the representation of women in STEM fields. Design/methodology/approach The authors report the results of a questionnaire survey of women (n = 375) working in STEM industries in the Middle East and North Africa region who have or had a mentor during their careers. Structural equation modelling is used to examine the proposed hypotheses. Findings The results indicate that both mentoring and coping self-efficacy positively influence affective occupational commitment. Coping self-efficacy is also found to partially mediate the relationship between mentoring and affective occupational commitment. Practical implications The authors recommend that researchers and practitioners give more attention to the contextual factors such as mentoring and its contribution to the coping self-efficacy and affective occupational commitment of employees in STEM occupations. Originality/value In this study, the authors investigate individual and contextual factors that have potential to enhance women's occupational commitment in STEM industries based on the Career Self-Management Model.",art

Purpose To cope with the workforce shortages brought by population ageing, it is critical to understand the workplace micro-foundations that determine the mechanisms of older workers' early retirement intentions. Drawing on the conservation of resource theory, this study examines the spillover effect of strain-based family-to-work conflict (SFWC) on early retirement intentions, with emotional exhaustion as a mediator. Additionally, it investigates the contextual resources, HR practice flexibility, as a boundary condition for the above relationships. Design/methodology/approach The study tests the hypotheses by employing a multi-sourced matching sample of 231 workers (aged 45-65) and their 49 managers. Findings The results of cross-level analysis revealed that SFWC has a positive indirect relationship with early retirement intentions, through increased emotional exhaustion. The relationship between emotional exhaustion and early retirement intentions is weaker when older employees experience higher HR practice flexibility. Originality/value This study is the first to use a resources perspective to analyse early retirement mechanisms, and it examines the spillover effect of SFWC on early retirement intentions. The findings also contribute to the literature on the role of HR practice for ageing workers.",art
10.1108/PR-07-2020-0506,"The joint impact of servant leadership and team-based HRM practices on team expediency: the mediating role of team reflexivity. Purpose This study focuses on an emerging deviant behavior at the team level and investigates when and why the team level processes reduce team expedient behavior. Anchored on the input-process-outcome (I-P-O) theoretical framework for studying team effectiveness, it conceptualizes and tests a research model where servant leadership and team-based human resource management (HRM practices) serve as a team-level input that interacts to influence the process of team reflexivity and ultimately reduces team expedient behavior as the outcome. Design/methodology/approach Data are from 109 teams involving a total of 584 employees and analyzed at the team level. Findings The findings provide empirical support that team-based HRM practices positively moderate the relationship between servant leadership and team reflexivity and that team reflexivity transforms the influence of servant leadership into reduced team expedient behavior. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. Research limitations/implications The participants in this study were drawn from diverse backgrounds (n = 584), and they were nested within 109 teams. Therefore, the authors were cautious of making claims that the findings would apply to every team in the context of China. The authors acknowledge that the research design of this study is not the strongest to test for causal relationship. Practical implications The findings show the synergistic role of servant leadership and team-based HRM practices and suggest organizations have both in place to mitigate deviant behaviors by teams. The study also suggests organizations develop and promote an environment where team members are motivated and encouraged to share their ideas, openly discuss experiences and set up forward plans. Social implications Organizations should focus on training their leaders of the behaviors such as supporting followers, enhancing subordinates' commitment to the collective goal and emphasizing the equality between themselves and subordinates. Organizations need to increase their awareness that the teams are more likely to perform their tasks by the means prescribed by the organizational rules if they communicate, discuss and get modeling or feedback from other teams. Originality/value This study enriches research on team-based HRM practices, which so far have received limited attention, and deserves further investigation. It sharpens the underlying mechanism that translates team-level input of leadership and HRM to the desired outcomes of reduced expedient behavior by introducing the role of team reflexivity. The study adds to the growing research on workplace deviance by addressing team-level expedient behavior.",art

Purpose This paper aims to explore the extent to which unionized employees are dissatisfied in Chinese Enterprise Trade Unions (CETUs) when they perceive high levels of the triple-role conflicts, as well as whether rights expectations will moderate these relationships. The authors define CETUs' triple-role conflicts as the extent to which CETUs and their cadres prioritize fulfilling the roles of preserving social stability (peace) and/or maintaining the production order (production) over protecting worker's rights and interests (workers rights). Design/methodology/approach Pilot study developed the scales via both qualitative and quantitative studies, which include item generation using the transcript of individual interviews with 36 informants, and exploratory factor analyses with 106 respondents. The study used a sample of 327 employees from more than 20 firms in North and Southwest China. Findings Results indicate high reliability and validity of the scales and provide largely consistent supports for our hypotheses: three dimensions of triple-role conflicts are negatively related to employees' satisfaction in CETUs, and rights expectations moderate these relationships. Originality/value This study developed three scales to respectively measure CETUs' triple-role conflicts, rights expectation and satisfaction in CETUs. More importantly, the findings shed light on the moderating mechanism of rights expectation in the relationships between triple-role conflicts and satisfaction in CETUs.",art

Purpose In this study, the authors examine how employees' retention intentions are related to their proactive personalities through the theoretical lens of the model of motivational force of turnover and the model of proactive motivation. More specifically, the authors also verify the partial mediation of work engagement on the main relationship and moderation of high-performance human resource practices (HPHRPs) in the process, which has rarely been explored previously. Design/methodology/approach The hypothesized model was tested using partial least squares structural equational modeling on a sample of 221 employees of a bank in Bangladesh. Findings The results showed that having a proactive personality is positively related to retention intentions due to enhanced work engagement. However, the effect of the interaction between having a proactive personality and HPHRPs was found to be not significant on work engagement and retention intention. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature by exploring the reason behind mixed results found in the relationship between having a proactive personality and retention intentions through work engagement as a mediator and HPHRPs as a contextual boundary condition in a single model.",art
10.1108/PR-06-2020-0474,"A new, established approach to managing misbehavior: system justification theory. Purpose - The status quo for managing deviant workplace behavior is underperforming. The current research offers a new approach for scholars and managers in approaching these misbehaviors. Namely, we outline how system justification theory, which holds that people are motivated to rationalize and justify the systems-including workplaces-to which they belong even when those systems disadvantage them or others, offers value in explaining and addressing the prevalence of such misbehaviors and contemporary failures in managing them.Design/methodology/approach - This conceptual research explores the situated role of onlookers to patterns of workplace misbehavior, like harassment. We explore existing scholarship on why and how onlookers respond to such actions, including cultural elements, and draw parallels between those accounts and the foundational concepts of system justification theory to demonstrate an unrealized theoretical overlap valuable for its immediate applications in research.Findings - The current paper establishes clear links between system justification theory and efforts to manage misbehavior, establishing system justifications as freezing forces in the culture of a workplace that must be unfrozen to successfully implement strategies for managing misbehavior. Further, we describe how organizational onlookers to misbehavior are subject to system justifications, which limit prescribed means of stopping these patterns of wrongdoing.Originality/value - Very limited organizational scholarship has utilized system justification theory, despite calls for such applications. Given the existing shortcomings in scholarship and management approaches to workplace misbehavior, the current research breaks from the status quo and offers an established theory as a new way to approach these misbehaviors.",art

The workforce is aging and becoming more age-diverse. To better support people working across the lifespan, it is important to understand the barriers they face and the consequences of such barriers. Drawing on the job demands-resources model, we evaluate the negative effects of age discrimination on employees' perceived work ability and the subsequent consequences for employee well-being, performance, and motivation. Using two field samples, with two and three data collection time-points respectively, we hypothesize and find support for age discrimination's direct negative effect on perceived work ability. Moreover, we find support for our hypotheses that age discrimination will have negative indirect effects on employee well-being, performance, and motivation through perceived work ability. Together, these studies contribute to the aging workforce literature and extend both the age discrimination and work ability literatures by identifying a mechanism through which age discrimination leads to negative consequences for employee well-being and work outcomes.",art
10.1002/hrm.22207,"Advancing work-life supportive contexts for the haves and have nots: Integrating supervisor training with work-life flexibility to impact exhaustion or engagement. Employers face many dilemmas in effectively implementing work-life flexibility to support employees' personal lives. A key issue is that some employees hold jobs with limited opportunities for work-life flexibility, making them susceptible to burnout; yet most employers believe they can do little to mitigate this dynamic. Furthermore, even when employees hold jobs with greater access to work-life flexibility, some do not take advantage of their flexibility to more fully engage in work and/or home roles. These issues are further exacerbated when supervisors are unsure of their role in supporting work-life flexibility. We identify work-life supportive context as a key factor that provides solutions to these dilemmas. Drawing on job demands resources theory, we posit that, when organizations provide work-life supportive training to supervisors, it promotes a work-life supportive context (i.e., signaling that the organization is supportive of employees' managing their work-life interface), which mitigates burnout for those with limited work-life flexibility and promotes engagement in work and home roles for those with greater work-life flexibility. Results from a year-long randomized field experiment suggest that, in contexts with trained supervisors and lower employee control over work schedules and boundaries (i.e., lower work-life flexibility), emotional exhaustion is reduced. In contexts with trained supervisors and higher employee control over work boundaries (i.e., higher work-life flexibility), family engagement increases. Surprisingly, irrespective of job access to work-life flexibility, supervisor participation in work-life support training did not enhance employee work engagement. Implications of our findings for fostering work-life supportive contexts are considered.",art

Drawing on social resources theory, we examine the impact of developmental job experience (DJE) on employees' job performance and the role of the team context in this relationship. In a multisource, multiwave dataset of 354 employees working on 40 teams in seven Chinese companies, we find that DJE has a positive indirect relationship with job performance through increasing employees' information and support seeking. This positive indirect relationship is stronger for employees on teams with a high average DJE and low variance in DJE; it is significantly weaker for employees on teams with a low average DJE and a high variance in DJE. These results reveal that the work and team contexts play important roles in the relationship between DJE and employees' work outcomes.",art
10.1002/hrm.22141,"Building then dismantling relational coordination: Mechanisms that distinguish functional and dysfunctional dynamics between HR practices and relational coordination. With the growing importance of relational coordination in today's multidisciplinary, interdependent work environment, practitioners are faced with challenges in designing and implementing relationship-oriented HR practices. We aim to identify key mechanisms either enabling or inhibiting the functional interplay between HR practices and relational coordination. Through an inductive qualitative study of a newsroom organization in Korea before and after the changes in its HR practices, we compared and contrasted functional and dysfunctional dynamics among HR practices, interpersonal relationships, and relational coordination. Before the changes, reporters coordinated across levels and functions as HR practices integrated formal and informal interactions and supported the shared notion on which professional behaviors and values are expected of a reporter. However, with the changes in HR practices, relational coordination among reporters dismantled as they experienced segregation between formal and informal interactions and upheld two different notions of journalistic values. Reporters were divided into two separate informal groups which rarely overlapped with formal work groups and these segregated interactions prevented reporters from sharing knowledge across levels and functions. Further, with the conflicting notion of journalistic values, reporters constantly debated over specific goals of practicing journalism and expressed disrespect toward those who held a different set of journalistic values. These findings redirect research by highlighting the fragility of relational coordination and the importance of designing HR practices which reflect formal and informal relational dynamics among employees and consolidate members under the same shared notion of professional values.",art

Human resource (HR) practices are potent in shaping workplace social relationships, which play a crucial role in employees' well-being. While the role of formal relationships (i.e., relationships based on prescribed work roles) has received relatively more research attention, little is known about the nexus between HR practices, informal relationships at work and employee well-being. Drawing on social interdependence theory, we conducted two studies to investigate how high commitment work systems (HCWS) affect employee well-being through workplace friendship, beyond the effects of formal interpersonal relationships. In Study 1, using time-lagged data from a sample of 253 full-time employees, we found that workplace friendship, a type of informal relationship at work, mediated the relationship between HCWS and employee well-being. In addition, task interdependence strengthened the relationship between HCWS and workplace friendship as well as the indirect effect of HCWS on employee well-being. In Study 2, we replicated these findings and extended them to multiple forms of well-being using multilevel data collected at three time points from 310 employees in 61 organizations.

Job crafting is theorized to operate via changes that employees make to their work designs, yet this critical mechanism has remained scarcely tested. This study examined whether job crafting facilitates changes in two types of challenge demands, namely workload and job complexity, and hindrance demands and whether these changes explain why job crafting may have both positive and negative implications for employee well-being. We utilized a two-wave sample of 2,453 employees to examine the relationships between job crafting and within-person changes in job demands, work engagement, and burnout. The findings showed that approach type of job crafting was related to increases in work engagement via increased job complexity. However, approach crafting was also associated with increases in burnout via increased workload. Avoidance type of job crafting, in turn, was related to increases in burnout and decreases in work engagement via decreased job complexity. The findings imply that job crafting may both promote and mitigate employee well-being depending on how it changes specific features of work design and that also approach crafting may deteriorate well-being. We discuss the practical implications of different types of job crafting on work design and employee well-being.",art

Purpose - The purpose of this review is to understand whether The Great Resignation has emerged as a concept within the popular media and academic because it is based on fact or whether it has emerged because it broadly aligns with a dominant neoliberal ideology.Design/methodology/approach - This paper critically reviews United Kingdom (UK) government data to establish evidence for The Great Resignation. Thus, the purpose is to understand whether there has been an increased propensity for workers to leave or change their jobs due to attitudinal changes emerging from the experience of the Covid-19 pandemic.Findings - Based on this review, there is limited evidence that The Great Resignation has been occurring within the UK. Nonetheless, there have been extensive commentries in both the popular press and academic outlets that have been attempting to evidence the phenomenon. Some of academic writing is drirven by narratives emerging from the press which should thus warrent consideration of the extent to which academics are losing control over conceptual and theoretical development.Originality/value - The key contribution that is made by this piece is the questioning of concepts that have entered the common vernacular.

Purpose The current study inspects pathways through which job crafting relates to the quality of employees' working lives. To date, this has been mostly done either by linking job crafting to individual job characteristics or by investigating its association with separate aspects of occupational well-being (such as work engagement), whereas empirical evidence about how it may affect one's overall work situation remains scarce. Design/methodology/approach To address this question, the authors conducted latent profile analyses based on selected job resources and job demands, which allowed the authors to derive distinct work environment patterns prevailing in a heterogeneous sample of 1,064 employees. Four patterns were identified denoting a passive, high-strain, low-strain and optimally balanced work environment types. The authors then tested the hypothesis that job crafting would relate to employees' odds of exposure to these patterns and that the latter would differentiate between high and low work engagement. Findings Approach job crafting was related to higher odds of being exposed to a favourably balanced work environment, and the reverse was true of avoidance crafting. Work engagement differed as a function of the quality of the work environment. Furthermore, the results suggested a potentially indirect link between approach job crafting and work engagement via exposure to different work environment types, whereas avoidance crafting related to lower work engagement only directly. Originality/value The findings contribute to theory testing and practice by providing a holistic representation of the work environment and then interlinking its features with employee proactivity and engagement.",art

Purpose This paper aims to extend the traditional conceptualization of localization, which has largely focused on recruitment, by examining employability and retention as crucial determinants of localization success. Design/methodology/approach Using survey data from local (Emirati) employees in private sector organizations in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the authors develop a holistic model of localization and test the relationships between stereotypes, organizational socialization, employability and retention outcomes, using Smart-PLS. Findings Among the main findings are the significant influence of stereotypes on organizational socialization (OS) experiences of Emirati employees, with a negative relationship between work ethics stereotypes and perceptions of OS experiences. Strong evidence is also found for the indirect effects of OS experiences on retention of Emirati employees, mediated by employability. Research limitations/implications This study contributes to the literature on localization by examining the relationships between key variables not examined together in previous research. In terms of limitations, the cross-sectional nature of the study prevents the identification of direction of causality among these relationships. Since employee integration, as part of localization efforts, is a gradual process, future research should include longitudinal studies. Practical implications Employability has emerged as a significant challenge for organizations and governments working to implement successful localization initiatives. This study's findings highlight several opportunities for organizational and governmental policy interventions to support successful localization.

Purpose This study investigates why and when leader favorable feedback inhibits employees' withdrawal behaviors. The authors propose that leader favorable feedback reduces employees' withdrawal behaviors via employees' gratitude toward the leader. The authors further posit that this mediation is contingent on leader-member exchange, arguing that as the quality of leader-member exchange increases, employees are more likely to feel grateful and are less likely to withdraw from work. Design/methodology/approach Two-wave, multisource field data collected from 662 employees were used to test our hypotheses. Findings Employees' feelings of gratitude mediated the negative relationship between leader favorable feedback and employees' withdrawal behavior. The negative effect of gratitude on withdrawal behavior was stronger under higher levels of leader-member exchange, as was the indirect effect of leader favorable feedback on withdrawal behavior via employees' gratitude. Originality/value These results contribute to a social exchange-based understanding of gratitude as an emotional mechanism underlying the feedback and withdrawal relationship and provide important practical implications for managers.",art

Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured interviews with a cohort of 43 mentors and their mentees plus key informants were conducted. It is a longitudinal qualitative study undertaken with a year's cohort of mentors (referred to as devilmasters) and mentees (devils) in the profession of law, amongst Scottish barristers, advocates. Findings The meanings of mentoring differed widely between individuals. Mentoring relationships differed in their depth, quality and benefits the mentees received. The research findings reveal the inconsistencies and inequalities that are a fundamental part of the experience of mentoring that, as yet, the research literature has missed. The research also revealed how mentoring alone was not enough and that structured training was required to supplement mentoring. Further, there is a dependency to be found in mentoring. The mentoring process is power laden. Research limitations/implications Researchers may need to provide a definition of mentoring to those they research. Power needs to be fore-grounded in research.

Purpose Building on the theories of social exchange and organizational support, this study proposes a research model to investigate the impact of green human resources management (GHRM) on nonprofit employees' green work-related outcomes, namely green voice behavior, green knowledge-sharing behavior and green helping behavior. In the model, perceived green organizational support (PGOS) is theorized and employed as an intervening mechanism between the examined linkages. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected in two different waves from 408 employees working in the Palestinian nonprofit sector. Covariance based-structural equation modeling was used to validate the study's research model and to examine the hypotheses. Findings The results indicated that GHRM is positively associated with green voice behavior, green knowledge-sharing behavior and green helping behavior. Moreover, the results show that PGOS exhibits a significant mediation effect between the aforesaid links. This study thus provides initial empirical evidence in the field of GHRM, with particular focus on the nonprofit sector. Research limitations/implications This research provides a roadmap to nonprofit managers and practitioners on how GHRM can encourage employees to speak up, share information and help others in the environmental and green domain.

Purpose Drawing on social information processing theory, the purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between team reward interdependence and team performance, treating shared leadership as mediator and team average job-based psychological ownership as moderator. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from a field sample of 72 knowledge-based work teams comprised of 466 team members and their team leaders. Data were analysed using hierarchical regression analysis and moderated path analysis. Findings Team reward interdependence was positively related to team performance through shared leadership. Team average job-based psychological ownership moderated both the relationship between team reward interdependence and shared leadership, and the indirect relationship between team reward interdependence and team performance. Research limitations/implications The shared leadership literature is extended by exploring the antecedents of shared leadership from the perspective of team reward interdependence, and by examining the moderating role of team average job-based psychological ownership. Practical implications Organizations and managers should pay attention to team pay system design and be aware of the importance of employees' psychological ownership towards their jobs in promoting shared leadership in teams. Originality/value This study sheds light on the antecedents of shared leadership from the perspective of team incentives and examines antecedent boundary conditions through the moderating role of job-based psychological ownership.",art

Purpose - With a foundation in social exchange theory, this study examines the relationship between servant leadership and three types of workplace mistreatment - bullying, incivility and ostracism - while also considering a mediating role of trust in the leader and a moderating role of the ethical climate.Design/methodology/approach - Three time-lagged sets of data (N = 431) were collected among employees working in various sectors.Findings - Servant leadership relates significantly to trust in the leader, as well as to workplace bullying, incivility and ostracism. In turn, trust in the leader mediates the relationship between servant leadership and all three types of workplace mistreatment. The results also indicate the presence of moderated mediation, in that the indirect effect of servant leadership on workplace mistreatment is moderated by the ethical climate.Originality/value - This study adds to extant research by examining the mediating mechanism of trust in leaders with servant leadership and workplace mistreatment, along with interactive effects of ethical climate.",art

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the existing literature by providing insights about how employees make attributions about the reasons why management adopts HRM practices based on a case study of a company in Turkey. Design/methodology/approach The case study was carried out through semi-structured interviews with multiple employee groups aimed at capturing a broad range of perspectives. The data were processed by way of categorical and frequency analyses, which are forms of content analysis. Findings Non-managerial employees make similar attributions regarding recruitment and selection, training, performance as well as career development and benefits. Research limitations/implications Acknowledging different views regarding the changing nature of employees' attributions, qualitative longitudinal research would provide more rigorous analysis in terms of ascertaining whether there are any alterations in employees' attitudes towards HRM practices over time. Practical implications Management and practitioners can draw valuable insights from the fact that when the meanings attached to HR practices by different employee groups are agreed upon, this may lead to their more enthusiastic involvement with these practices. Originality/value This study examines employees' attributions regarding HR practices through a case study. It provides evidence that when employees ascribe positive meanings to such practices, they are more committed to them and this may promote more favourable outcomes regarding HR efforts.",art

Purpose The issue of age in organizations has become increasingly salient given expanding age profiles, from millennials to baby boomers. The purpose of this article is to improve the understanding of how age affects individuals' work-related attitudes and behaviors, the authors take a life span perspective to investigate how age profiles moderate the relationship between job resources and work engagement and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Design/methodology/approach The authors collected responses from 270 employees of multinational firms operating in India and conducted multiple regression analyses to examine the hypotheses. Findings The authors found that age profiles are significant predictors of work engagement. Specifically, the relationship between development opportunities and work engagement was stronger for younger employees than for older employees. However, age profiles were neither positively related to OCB nor a moderator of the job resources-OCB relationship. Originality/value The findings provide empirical evidence of the life span perspective, suggesting that age profiles influence work engagement. This is pertinent for organizations offering employees development opportunities to enhance work engagement.",art
10.1002/hrm.22248,"Relational incongruence in neurodiverse workgroups: Practices for cultivating autistic employee authenticity and belonging. Although much research has sought to understand how employees come to align themselves with the social norms and routines of their workgroups, management theory has largely overlooked the possibility that such alignment might be fundamentally at odds with what it means to be autistic. Autism, which accounts for a large share of organizational neurodiversity, is associated with seeing and processing the world differently from the non-autistic societal norm. In the workplace, autistic employees often experience barriers to inclusion, in large part due fundamental dissimilarities in how they interact with and connect to others. To identify the barriers to autistic employees' workgroup inclusion, we develop a multilevel framework centered around relational incongruence, or differences in patterns of interrelating across (autistic and non-autistic) neurotypes. We propose that non-autistic workgroup norms (e.g., for the use of imprecise language) exacerbate relational incongruence, which in turn hinders experiences of authenticity and belonging for the autistic workgroup member. Finally, we identify managerial practices (e.g., relational job crafting) that are likely to protect against the negative consequences of relational incongruence, by fostering workgroup climates of normalized variance in patterns of interrelating and shared understandings across neurotypes.",art
10.1002/hrm.22241,"Relational spirals and thriving: A longitudinal investigation of older workers. Thriving is believed to occur when employees feel a sense of progress and momentum in the organization. This conceptual basis for thriving is inherently temporal-implying an underlying individual change process-which sets thriving apart from other well-being criteria in the Human Resource Management literature. However, surprisingly little research has demonstrated and unpacked the change and development processes that lead to thriving. In this article, we develop and test a theoretical model of the dynamic origins of thriving in a socially important context: the aging workforce. Specifically, we propose that older workers thrive when they experience relational spirals: a deepening of the employee-organization relationship as psychological contracts and role expansion drive each other in a mutually reinforcing spiral. Results from a large-scale nationally representative longitudinal study of 3370 Australian older workers-spanning 1.5 years and three time points-support the proposed model. Older workers' relational psychological contracts and role expansion formed a mutually reinforcing spiral process over time which ultimately led to higher levels of thriving. These results held even after imposing autoregressive control of lagged variables at earlier time points, and after accounting for the contributions of transactional psychological contracts to the spiral process. Our theorizing and empirical approach brings dynamic processes to the forefront of HR research on thriving, and points to implications for the role of HR in successful aging.",art

The article focuses on decisions to exercise and hold company stock at the maturity of a broad-based employee stock options plan. It investigates why some participants choose an uncertain and risky future reward when an immediate and certain increase in wealth could be secured at exercise. It draws on and expands the mixed gambles perspective in behavioral agency theory, utilizing a combination of stock price data and employee survey data from British companies with tax-approved stock option plans. It is found that the decision to take a gamble is influenced (negatively) by the extent of stock price lows (relative to prices at exercise) in the year prior to exercise, and by the risk preferences of the option holder. The findings contribute to further development of the mixed gambles perspective as an explanation of stock option behavior, showing that individual characteristics as well as some stock price movements affect behavior.",art
10.1002/hrm.22066,"Does women's board representation affect non-managerial gender inequality?. Research examining gender and corporate boards has explored how women's representation impacts firm strategy and policy, particularly around corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues related to communities and other relevant stakeholders, the environment, and diversity and equity initiatives. However, fewer studies have examined how women's representation on boards affects gender inequality in firms. The studies that have been conducted generally focus on gender board diversity and the appointment of women executives. Yet, prior research has not sufficiently examined women's board representation and gender equality below executive level. Does women's representation have broader effects on gender equity beyond top leadership? And if so, is there a critical mass effect? In this article, we examine the relationship between women's board representation and non-managerial gender segregation. Gender segregation is an ideal measure of gender equality given that it captures the evenness of the distribution of women and men across jobs within workplaces and its well-known relationship to gender disparities in earnings and other job rewards. Drawing on Australian organization data (2014-2019) we find that the contemporaneous relationship between women's board representation and gender segregation is nonsignificant, but becomes significant and increases in magnitude with 1, 2, and 3-year lags. Our critical mass analysis suggests that having one woman on a board may not be enough to promote change but rather two or more women directors, or holding 20% or more board seats, appears to be more effective in reducing gender segregation. These findings demonstrate that the appointment of more women to corporate boards has broader effects on workplace gender equity beyond top leadership teams.",art
10.1002/hrm.22243,"Factors shaping the employment outcomes of neurodivergent and neurotypical people: Exploring the role of flexible and homeworking practices. Supporting neurodivergent-inclusive workplaces is an increasingly important consideration in Human Resource Management (HRM). While a strengths-based approach to neurodivergence has been advocated, empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of HRM practices that support high-quality employment outcomes for neurodivergent people is lacking. Drawing on a nationally representative sample of over 25,000 people in the United Kingdom, we examine the influence of neurodivergence on multiple employment outcomes, including employment status, underemployment, employment precarity, job tenure, and hourly wages. We theorize and empirically examine how flexible- and homeworking practices moderate the effects of neurodivergence on employment outcomes. Our findings show that neurodivergent people are twice as likely to be in precarious employment and more than 10 times as likely to be in temporary employment compared to neurotypical people. Neurodivergent individuals are also significantly more likely to experience underemployment and have lower employment tenure; however, controlling for other factors, we find no significant differences in hourly wages. We find that flexible working practices can substantially improve employment outcomes for neurodivergent people, raising significant questions regarding the role of HRM in enabling more neurodiverse workplaces. We critically reflect on the implications of our findings for policy, practice, and future research.",art

We document the size and scope of the industry of for-profit vendors that now handles a considerable proportion of human resource tasks for individual US employers, a collection we describe as the human capital industry. Outsourcing these tasks changes how the human resources function is executed in ways we describe below. This change should matter to researchers if they are interested in choosing topics that have relevance, and it should also matter to teachers of human resources who want to present an accurate description of practice to students. Aside from the now remarkable size of the HR industry, arguably its most important attribute is its marketing efforts, which now drive the agenda for the field of HR.

10.1002/hrm.22157,"The adoption of human resource practices to support employees affected by intimate partner violence: Women representation in leadership matters. Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a global public health issue that negatively impacts organizations and their employees. Research suggests that organizations can play a supportive role to lessen this negative impact. However, it has been relatively silent on the conditions under which organizations choose to play such a role. Integrating social role and critical mass perspectives, we examine the extent to which organizations adopt human resource (HR) practices to support employees affected by IPV. Specifically, we argue that organizations are more likely to adopt IPV-related HR practices when they are led by female Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and Top Management Teams (TMTs) with more female members. Furthermore, we argue that when women's representation reaches a critical mass plateau, appointing more women in TMTs has no incremental impact, and this non-linear relationship moderates the CEO gender effect. Overall, we found support for our hypotheses based on a survey study of HR professionals from 414 Australian organizations (Study 1) and an archival study using 2 years of the Workplace Gender Equality Agency data from 4186 Australian organizations (Study 2). Theoretical and practical implications on the influence of gender configurations in leadership positions on the adoption of diversity, equity, and inclusion-related HR practices are discussed.",art
10.1002/hrm.22144,"Social networks and citizenship behavior: The mediating effect of organizational identification. Are employees more likely to identify with their organization and engage in helping behaviors on its behalf if the coworkers who make up their social networks identify and help the organization? We draw on social information processing theory, social learning theory, and research on diffusion of innovation to develop a model that predicts how relational (advice ties) and structural (structural equivalence) factors predict organizational identification and organizational citizenship. We argue that OI is neither a matter of individual perceptions generated in isolation, nor a simple function of the number of ties that an employee has, but that it is instead an outcome of relations and interactions with coworkers, as reflected in the social structure of the employing organization. We tested our model by conducting a social network study of employees in a construction company. Our findings show that (1) employees tend to have similar levels of OI to the OI of their advice ties; (2) employees who are structurally equivalent tend to demonstrate similar levels of OCB; (3) similarity in OI mediates the relationship between advice ties and similarity in OCB; and (4) advice ties with high and moderate levels of OI are most strongly associated with similarity in OCB. In a supplementary analysis we show that the social influence model that we tested offers a better explanation for the role that the social context plays in shaping OI than does a more ties, more OI model. We discuss implications for theory and practice.",art

Disruption in human resource management (HRM) practices necessitates processes of mutual adjustment within the organization that seeks to address these changes properly, overcome tensions, and fit strategic needs. In our single longitudinal case study of a new HRM practice development concerning blue-collar worker talent management, we examine how HR professionals and managers interact and develop new HRM practices as a response to disruptive work transformation. Considering these interactions from the perspective of HR ecosystem alignment dynamics, we find that both managers and HR professionals engaged in fruitful collaboration processes along three differentiated steps to provide value for the whole organization. We propose a grounded theorizing of HR ecosystem alignment that is based on the progression of successive convergent and divergent phases and introducing collaborative spaces of work.",art

Purpose - This study aims to enhance the effectiveness of knowledge markets and overall knowledge management (KM) practices within organisations. By addressing the challenge of internal knowledge stickiness, it seeks to demonstrate how machine learning and AI approaches, specifically a text-based AI method for personality assessment and regression trees for behavioural analysis, can automate and personalise knowledge market incentivisation mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach - The research employs a novel approach by integrating machine learning methodologies to overcome the limitations of traditional statistical methods. A natural language processing (NLP)-based AI tool is used to assess employees' personalities, and regression tree analysis is applied to predict and categorise behavioural patterns in knowledge-sharing contexts. This approach is designed to capture the complex interplay between individual personality traits and environmental factors, which traditional methods often fail to adequately address. Findings - Cognitive style was confirmed as a key predictor of knowledge-sharing, with extrinsic motivators outweighing intrinsic ones in market-based platforms. These findings underscore the significance of diverse combinations of environmental and individual factors in promoting knowledge sharing, offering key insights that can inform the automatic design of personalised interventions for community managers of such platforms. Originality/value - This research stands out as it is the first to empirically explore the interaction between the individual and the environment in shaping actual knowledge-sharing behaviours, using advanced methodologies. The increased automation in the process extends the practical contribution of this study, enabling a more efficient, automated assessment process, and thus making critical theoretical and practical advancements in understanding and enhancing knowledge-sharing behaviours.",art

We do this by focusing on the Italian context.Design/methodology/approachWe conduct a scoping review of data collected between 2018 and 2022 via Google Alerts (GA), a content change detection and notification service that is gaining popularity in scholarly research.FindingsOur findings suggest that the diffusion of PA applications in Italy, especially those of a descriptive nature, is growing. Most of the existing PA applications are positioned in a positive technocratic light, envisioning the value of PA for both employees and organizations. The value for the latter appears to be direct, while the value for employees is realized through organizational initiatives. The findings also suggest that while enablers can vary between PA application types, the barriers, especially technological and environmental, are generic for both descriptive and predictive/prescriptive PA applications.Originality/valueTheoretically, we propose a framework for analyzing PA applications, their values, enablers and barriers.

Purpose This study seeks to unpack the relationship between employees' exposure to workplace bullying and their turnover intentions, with a particular focus on the possible mediating role of perceived organizational politics and moderating role of creativity. Design/methodology/approach The hypotheses are tested with multi-source, multi-wave data collected from employees and their peers in various organizations. Findings Workplace bullying spurs turnover intentions because employees believe they operate in strongly politicized organizational environments. This mediating role of perceived organizational politics is mitigated to the extent that employees can draw from their creative skills though. Practical implications For managers, this study pinpoints a critical reason - employees perceive that they operate in an organizational climate that endorses dysfunctional politics - by which bullying behaviors stimulate desires to leave the organization. It also reveals how this process might be contained by spurring employees' creativity. Originality/value This study provides novel insights into the process that underlies the connection between workplace bullying and quitting intentions by revealing the hitherto overlooked roles of employees' beliefs about dysfunctional politics and their own creativity levels.",art

Latent moderated structural equations (LMS) method was used to test the mediating role of job crafting and meaningfulness and the moderating role of core self-evaluation (CSE) in the organizational support-employee thriving relationship. Findings POSSU has a direct, positive relationship with employee thriving at work. Moreover, this relationship is fully mediated by employees' job crafting (as an agentic work behavior) and meaningfulness (as a resource produced at work). In addition, contextual factor of POSSU synergistically interacts with individual characteristic of CSE to foster thriving at work.

There is an increasing body of research on algorithmic management (AM), but the field lacks measurement tools to capture workers' experiences of this phenomenon. Based on existing literature, we developed and validated the algorithmic management questionnaire (AMQ) to measure the perceptions of workers regarding their level of exposure to AM. Across three samples (overall n = 1332 gig workers), we show the content, factorial, discriminant, convergent, and predictive validity of the scale. The final 20-item scale assesses workers' perceived level of exposure to algorithmic: monitoring, goal setting, scheduling, performance rating, and compensation. These dimensions formed a higher order construct assessing overall exposure to algorithmic management, which was found to be, as expected, negatively related to the work characteristics of job autonomy and job complexity and, indirectly, to work engagement. Supplementary analyses revealed that perceptions of exposure to AM reflect the objective presence of AM dimensions beyond individual variations in exposure.

10.1002/hrm.22180,"How does human resource management balance exploration and exploitation? The differential effects of intellectual capital-enhancing HR practices on ambidexterity and firm innovation. After decades, dialogues on human resource management (HRM), intellectual capital (IC), and ambidexterity still continue, mirroring that the role of ambidextrous capability in translating the impact of HRM into superior performance remains unclarified. At this juncture, the current study proposes a novel theoretical framework to extend research on the relationship between IC-enhancing HR practices and innovation. It is done sophisticatedly by examining how firm exploitative and exploratory capabilities mediate the relationship between different combinations of HR configurations and firm innovation. To this end, we designed rigorous time-lagged research with three waves of data collection from the Iranian healthcare sector. Our analyses revealed that firm explorative and exploitative capabilities significantly mediate the relationship between human, social, and organizational capital-enhancing HR configurations and firm innovation. More conspicuously, by unraveling interaction patterns among distinct HR configurations, our study revealed the intricacies of the functioning of IC-enhancing HR practices in fueling firm ambidexterity. Hence, our study offers design options to navigate through exploitation and exploration in light of the firm's core innovation strategy. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings and suggest future research avenues.",art
10.1002/hrm.22179,"Getting from valid to useful: End user modifiability and human capital analytics implementation in selection. A major problem in employee selection coalesces around convincing decision-makers (e.g., hiring managers) to use analytically derived models. Existing recommendations in the literature largely focus on convincing executives to adopt analytical models and then exert their top-down influence on lower-level hiring decisions. In contrast to these solutions, we explore end user modifiability (i.e., allowing decision-makers to modify a statistical model before use) as a bottom-up approach for increasing hiring managers' implementation of analytical recommendations. From a utility standpoint, we consider how incorporating end user modifiability into hiring decisions will result in a less statistically valid, but potentially more valuable, organizational selection process. We explore these ideas in two studies. In Study 1, we experimentally test whether model modification increases decision-maker reliance on a statistical model, as well as how much decision-makers need to modify a model in order to use it. In Study 2, we examine the extent that modifiability introduces implicit biases that might adversely affect marginalized groups. Results suggest that modifiability can increase decision-makers' perceived usefulness of a model and, importantly, that only a small amount of modifiability is needed to elicit this effect. Further, end user modifications were statistically insignificant predictors of hiring rates across race-based subgroups, though supplementary analyses suggest important cautionary nuance. Given that analytical models are rarely perfectly or wholly implemented, end user modifiability may offer a viable solution for organizations seeking to increase the implementation of algorithmic guidance in selection decisions, even if it deviates modestly from a statistical optimality.",art
10.1002/hrm.22149,"A contingency approach to HRM and firm innovation: The role of national cultures. Companies adopt various HRM practices to enhance employees' abilities, motivations, and opportunities to foster innovation. Are these practices universally effective or culturally contingent? In this study, we draw on the Ability-Motivation-Opportunity (AMO) model and examine the effectiveness of three representative practices using a dataset of 304 companies from 13 countries or regions. We find that HRM practices need to fit in a supplementary/complementary way with national cultures to facilitate firm innovation: 1. cross-functional training (i.e., an ability-enhancing practice) is more effective in collectivistic rather than individualistic cultures (supplementary fit); 2. financial rewards for innovation (i.e., a motivation-enhancing practice) are more effective in masculine rather than feminine cultures (supplementary fit); and 3. employee participation (i.e., an opportunity-enhancing practice) is more effective in high rather than low power distance cultures (complementary fit). By building on the notion of supplementary/complementary fit, these findings extend our knowledge of the AMO model in the context of HRM and innovation management with a cultural contingency perspective.",art

The emergence of the temporary organization has ushered in a new logic of organizing accompanied by paradigm-shifting challenges with respect to how the evolving nature of work, workers, and collective effort are to be understood. To capture the complexity inherent in this new order, and to broaden our focus from the organization to the enfolding ecosystem within which temporary organizing must be situated and understood, we engage in problematization to develop a multi-level framework for theorizing the contemporary human resource management ecosystem. Curating insights from complexity science, we conceptualize this ecosystem as a complex adaptive one and we propose a framework that integrates key structural (open boundaries and relational constitution), emergent (contextual and complex causality), and temporal (dynamic and adaptive) properties. To deepen lines of inquiry around these defining elements, we advance a series of propositions for testing, and we outline a range of theoretical, methodological, and practical implications that arise from our work.",art

Integrating conservation of resource (COR) theory and the theory of relational organizing, we conceptualize expatriate-host country national (HCN) knowledge transfer as resource gains between the sender and receiver. Based on a sample of 107 expatriate-HCN dyads, we found that when the knowledge receiver, be it an expatriate or HCN, is high on cultural intelligence (CQ), the sender will be more likely to perceive higher levels of trust in the receiver and shared vision with the receiver. These cognitive responses to the receiver's CQ are instrumental in facilitating the receiver's knowledge acquisition. We also identified the sender's perceptions of the collaborative-based HR configuration as a contextual condition that strengthens the relationship between the knowledge receiver's CQ and the sender's perceived trust in the receiver and shared vision with the receiver.",art

Human resource (HR) strength research has substantially informed an understanding of the relationship between HR practices and employee-level outcomes. However, a key unresolved issue is whether employee perceptions of HR strength act as a mediator or a moderator in the relationship between HR practices and these outcomes. A meta-analysis of 42 studies (comprising 65 samples and 29,444 unique participants) was conducted to address this issue. Results support the mediating hypothesis for all five employee outcomes: employee reactions, proactive behavior, burnout, performance, and perceived organizational effectiveness. Conversely, the moderating hypothesis was only supported for employee performance. In addition, we examined five study characteristics (the operationalization of perceived HR strength, research study design, industry, sampling strategy, and publication status) as moderators. Using this analysis, we test the robustness of our main results and identify sources of heterogeneity in the results across studies. The results show that the mediating hypothesis still holds under different study designs and contexts. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.",art

Over the past two decades, a growing body of research on human resource management (HRM) has analyzed the relationship between international HRM and institutions. This work has primarily been informed by two leading streams of theory-organizational institutionalism and comparative institutionalism. However, these two dominant streams have seen much juxtaposition, but little logical integration. Moreover, scholars have paid little attention to the dynamics of contextualization (more specifically, institutional development and evolution), which limits the relevance of extant research. In this article, we review the extant literatures and their intellectual origins and develop an integrative research agenda that emphasizes the multilevel nature of HRM and evolution under external institutional change.",art
10.1002/hrm.22269,"Fraught Expectations: A Fairness Heuristic Process Model of the Pros and Cons of CSR for Talent Acquisition. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is purely an asset when it comes to talent acquisition: that is the dominant narrative among Human Resource Management (HRM) practitioners and scholars alike. Growing evidence, however, gives reason to question this assumption. Accordingly, in this conceptual paper, we develop a process model to articulate both the pros and cons of CSR for recruitment. Using fairness heuristic theory as a central organizing framework, we integrate three theoretical perspectives into the HRM and micro-CSR literatures. First, we leverage dual-processing attribution theory to propose that job seekers process information about CSR through both heuristic and deliberative processes, leading them to attribute employer CSR to substantive or symbolic motives. We explain how CSR attributions represent a fairness heuristic, meaning a proxy for how trustworthy job seekers appraise an employer to be. Second, invoking expectancy violation theory, we propose that the more job seekers attribute employer CSR to substantive (symbolic) motives, the higher (lower) their justice expectations will be, thereby increasing (decreasing) the consequences to employers for violating those expectations. Third, expanding scholarship on the dynamic nature of organizational fairness perceptions, we propose that job seekers update their attributions of employer CSR in a recursive cycle that can improve, but tends to degrade, as the recruitment process unfolds-particularly if they have high expectations to begin with. In so doing, we nudge the talent acquisition literature beyond static, fixed-in-time accounts to a more representative description of the dynamic and dual-sided role of CSR in recruitment over time.",art

Team performance is contingent on nuanced approaches to risk management-demanding both risky and cautious strategic orientations. However, research surrounding how teams navigate this balance is limited. We argue that both positive and negative affective diversity can aid team performance, through affective diversity's impact on the team's risky and cautious behaviors. Furthermore, we argue that team trait regulatory focus strengthens these relationships. Using a controlled laboratory setting with 58 teams in a complex, uncertain team task that requires both risky and cautious strategies for successful performance, results indicate that positive affective diversity relates to team performance through promoting risky behavior, while negative affective diversity relates to team performance through promoting cautious behavior. Teams high in trait prevention-focus are more attuned to the information signals in teams with negative affective diversity, but we did not find that promotion focus impacted outcomes of positive affective diversity.",art

This study aims to advance current understanding concerning situational cues that trigger identity threat at the workplace among temporary workers and associated effects on their integration outcomes in the flexible employment scenario. We used the social identity threat theory to empirically investigate the impact of the extent to which regular employees' job conditions are superior to those of temporary workers on these workers' outcomes, through the identity threat. In addition, we examined the moderating role of organizations' social integration practices. We conducted two empirical studies involving technical temporary workers in Chinese companies, in which we used polynomial regression analyses and response surface modeling. In Study 1, using a two-wave time-lagged design, we analyzed data from 480 temporary workers, and in Study 2, using a three-wave time-lagged multi-source dyadic design, we analyzed matching data from 371 temporary workers and 64 supervisors. Our findings indicate that the extent to which regular employees' job conditions surpass those of temporary workers is positively associated with identity threat among the latter, increasing their turnover intention and undermining their job performance. Moreover, temporary workers' perceptions of their organizations' social integration practices weaken the effects of the extent to which regular employees' job conditions surpass those of temporary workers. Thus, this study contributes to related literature on social identity threat and temporary workers, and to practice, by offering offers insightful implications for managers to effectively manage this threat.",art

Organizations utilize self-regulation promoting interventions to empower employees in managing challenges and resources autonomously. However, there is limited understanding of how these interventions impact employee task performance and innovative behavior, as well as which processes are critical for their effectiveness. Therefore, a field experiment was conducted to examine the effects of two self-regulation promoting interventions-the Productivity Measurement and Enhancement Systems intervention (ProMES), a job crafting intervention, and their combination-on individual employee performance and innovation through selected process variables. We collected data before, during, and after the interventions over 16 weeks among 123 employees across three experimental and one control group. Consistent with predictions, participants of the ProMES intervention reported a higher level of perceived team climate, which consequently contributed to greater individual innovative behavior. Participants in the job crafting intervention exhibited an increase in job crafting behaviors, which consequently increased innovative behavior and task performance. Unexpectedly, the combined intervention yielded negative effects on both innovative behavior and task performance. The findings suggest that while self-regulation promoting interventions increase favorable outcomes through different mechanisms their combination may impair relevant processes and, more generally, overwhelm employees.",art

With heightened uncertainties and risks in the fluctuating business environment, existing studies have concentrated on elucidating how service organizations leverage human resource practices to adapt to and survive such unforeseen and disruptive threats. However, how such practices could serve the strategic objective of cultivating a sustainably thriving workforce across different situations is not well understood. Thriving is a core transitional state that fosters positive behaviors, such as creative customer-related problem-solving. Applying social information processing theory, we propose and test a model by exploring how organizations that engage in thriving-oriented human resource management (HRM) encourage employees to take responsibility and promote constructive change, thereby activating their creative problem-solving behaviors. Specifically, we theorize and develop measures to promote thriving-oriented HRM in Study 1. In Study 2, we collected multisource and multi-wave data from 296 frontline service employees and 45 supervisors in China. Our findings reveal that thriving-oriented HRM is positively related to felt responsibility for change, which ultimately encourages creative problem-solving. We also show that the threat imposed by a crisis, that is, the COVID-19 pandemic, strengthens the positive relationship between thriving-oriented HRM and felt responsibility for change. Our study contributes to the HRM literature, especially on thriving-oriented HRM and employee perception, and has practical implications for service organizations in the uncertain context.",art

However, empirical evidence of this change is scarce and inconclusive. This qualitative study examines the changes currently unfolding in the career structure of the civil service by eliciting the experiences and views of senior Foreign Offices (FOs) staff in four countries: 198 state ambassadors from the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, and Denmark were interviewed about their career trajectories. The data were analyzed using a thematic analysis framework. The findings revealed a gradual breakdown of the structures and policies that support traditional careers, and the emergence of new principles and practices that characterize contemporary careers.

Using an inductive approach and an employee-centric theoretical lens, we investigated employees' (n = 426) perceptions and satisfaction levels with the revamped PMS in three Indian IT services and business solutions multinational enterprises. Employees perceived the present purposes of PMS marginally more favorably than those in the past; however, the gap between the present and future aspirational perceived purposes of PMS was significantly much higher. Satisfaction levels with different dimensions of PMS and alignment of PMS with other human resource functions and leader-member exchange were only modest. Employees mentioned goal setting and continuous feedback as the most positive features of the current PMSs, and transparency, 360 degrees feedback, and adherence to timelines-as improvement areas.

Why do some line managers implement HR practices as intended while others do not? We draw on the concept of accountability focus to highlight that managers' HR implementation behavior is driven by what they feel accountable for, and we examine how accountability focus is shaped by characteristics of managers' role. We test our theoretical model across two field studies: a three-wave survey with managers and a study with dyads of managers and employees. When managers experienced more autonomy in their HR role, they felt more accountable for outcomes and were less likely to implement HR practices, but this was mitigated when managers also felt competent in their HR responsibilities. More competent managers felt more accountable for processes and in turn were more likely to implement HR practices, which positively related to employees' discretionary effort. Our findings highlight boundaries to managerial autonomy, and theoretical insights about the motivational mechanisms, which drive HR implementation, with implications for employees. We contribute to theory on managerial accountability by elaborating the nomological net of accountability focus and, by developing a measurement scale through several pilot studies, provide opportunities for further research.",art

As the COVID-19 pandemic has led to new ways of working, increased health concerns, and added responsibilities, employees are facing important challenges in doing their work that can affect their job-related well-being. This study aims to understand how different types of work support (i.e., perceived organizational support and supervisor accessibility) in response to environmental disruption interact with personality traits (i.e., core self-evaluations and future focus) to influence changes in employees' affective commitment to their organization and in their job-related well-being. We develop a moderated mediation model and test it on data collected from 295 individuals working in the United Kingdom. We find that work support for the COVID-19 pandemic, both perceived organizational support and supervisor accessibility, is associated with more positive changes in employees' job-related well-being and that this effect is mediated by changes in employees' affective commitment to their organization. Furthermore, we find that personality traits moderate the relationships between these two types of support and changes in affective commitment to the organization, with those relationships being more positive for employees with low core self-evaluations and for those with a high future focus.",art

Integrating theoretical perspectives on tokenism and perceived preferential selection, we explore whether the relationship between chief executive officers' (CEOs') external board memberships and CEO compensation is gendered. Based on recent pressures to diversify corporate boards, we theorize that female CEOs' memberships on external boards will result in less monetary compensation relative to male CEOs due to concerns of organizational decision-makers that female CEOs generally inhabit token or symbolic positions of limited value. Additionally, we present competing hypotheses (i.e., mitigation vs. exacerbation) regarding how this devaluation will be affected by female representation on the board of directors and compensation committee, respectively. Using a panel sample of 12,464 firm-year observations comprising of 1,805 unique firms and 2,782 unique CEOs, the relationship between CEO external board memberships and compensation is indeed weaker for female compared to male CEOs. Furthermore, this devaluation primarily occurred in organizations where there was stronger (vs. weaker) female representation on the board of directors or compensation committee. However, supplemental analyses revealed that this differential devaluation was mitigated when female executives on the board held greater power (i.e., chaired important committees), highlighting the importance of moving beyond mere representation to ensuring influence on boards for female directors.",art

10.1108/PR-10-2021-0774,"Helping as an opportunity and risk: an alternative side to gratitude in co-worker dyads. Purpose As workplaces and relationships evolve with increasing complexity, co-worker dynamics have become a key concern for HR managers and scholars. An important yet overlooked aspect of co-worker dynamics is gratitude. This paper adopts a relationship-specific conceptualization of gratitude and explores its influence on prosocial behaviors within co-worker dyads. The proposed model also suggests structural-relational factors under which these relationships are affected. Design/methodology/approach The conceptual paper draws insights from personal relationships to consider an alternative side of gratitude's prosocial action tendencies, thereby highlighting two: risk-oriented and opportunity-oriented. These assumptions are then situated within the affect theory of social exchange to predict gratitude's influence on prosocial behaviors within co-worker dyads. Findings The proposed model illuminates the importance of studying relationship-specific gratitude within co-worker relations by illustrating its effects on two types of prosocial action tendencies - opportunity-oriented and risk-oriented and varying prosocial behaviors (from convergent to divergent). Structural-relational factors, such as positional and physical distance between co-workers, are considered to affect these relationships. Originality/value While the study of gratitude in the workplace is emerging, little research has examined its influence on the nature of prosocial behaviors within co-worker relations. This paper advances the notion that gratitude serves an adaptive function in co-worker dyads, thereby highlighting the risk-oriented and opportunity-oriented continuum, and its implications for the type and scope of prosocial behaviors exchanged.",art
10.1108/PR-10-2021-0709,"Impact of workplace safety on well-being: the mediating role of thriving at work. Purpose Based on the socially embedded model of thriving at work and using the conservation of resources and job demands-resources theories, this study aims to examine the mediating role of thriving at work, as a personal resource, in the relationship between workplace safety, as job resource, and well-being. Design/methodology/approach The authors used structural equation modeling to test the mediation model on a sample of 350 correctional officers. Findings The results provided support to the authors' model. The authors found that workplace safety is positively linked to job satisfaction and negatively to health complaints, and these relationships are partially mediated by thriving at work. Consistent with the conservation of resources theory, thriving at the workplace is a mechanism that translates the positive effect of workplace safety on well-being. Originality/value The contribution of this research resides that a safe work environment leads to improved health and job satisfaction via thriving at work because thriving correctional officers feel energetic and able to acquire and apply knowledge and skills at workplace.",art
10.1108/PR-08-2021-0573,"You're so good-looking and wise, my powerful leaders! When deference becomes flattery in employee-authority relations. Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between employees' deference to leaders' authority and their upward ingratiatory behavior, which may be invigorated by two personal resources (dispositional greed and social cynicism) and two organizational resources (informational justice and forgiveness climate). Design/methodology/approach In this study survey data were collected among employees who work in the banking sector. Findings Strict adherence to leaders' authority stimulates upward ingratiatory behavior, especially when employees (1) have a natural tendency to want more, (2) are cynical about people in power, (3) believe they have access to pertinent organizational information and (4) perceive their organization as forgiving of mistakes. Practical implications For human resource (HR) managers, this study points to the risk that employees' willingness to comply blindly with the wishes of organizational leaders can escalate into excessive, inefficient levels of flattery. Several personal and organizational conditions make this risk particularly likely to materialize. Originality/value This study extends prior human resource management (HRM) research by revealing the conditional effects of an unexplored determinant of upward ingratiatory behavior, namely, an individual desire to obey organizational authorities unconditionally.",art

Purpose In the new post-COVID-19 work order, this study aims to examine whether and how individual-level social distancing interacts with workgroup-level socio-affective support to influence employee exhaustion and performance. Design/methodology/approach Multi-level analyses of time-lagged multi-source data from 231 employees nested in 34 workgroups were conducted to test our hypothesized relationships. Findings Analyses revealed a significant relationship between social distancing and employee performance via emotional exhaustion. Further, the positive relationship between social distancing and emotional exhaustion was attenuated by workgroup team orientation and support for innovation, and the indirect effect of social distancing on employee performance was weaker in workgroups with a high team orientation and high support for innovation. Originality/value This study extends the job demands-resources theory to the new work order and examines the impact of workplace social distancing on employee outcomes in the context of workgroup membership.",art

Purpose Companies around the globe increasingly receive immense shareholder scrutiny due to perceivably excessive executive director remuneration. The debate in South Africa intensifies due to severe pay inequality. The authors thus accounted for the perspectives of asset managers and listed financial services companies in South Africa pertaining to the impact of voting and engagement on director pay policies and practices. Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured interviews were conducted with selected asset managers, chief executive officers, chief financial officers and remuneration committee members of listed financial services companies to gauge their views on the impact of shareholder activism endeavours on remuneration governance. The qualitative data was analysed by conducting thematic analysis. Findings Most of the asset managers and financial services representatives preferred proactive, private engagement on pay concerns, given the impact thereof on voting outcomes, and ultimately director remuneration practices and policies. Independent remuneration committees have a prominent role in facilitating engagements with investors to ensure fair remuneration. Research limitations/implications The consequences should be clearer if organisations receive substantial votes against their pay policies and implementation reports. South African regulators can consider the two-strikes rule to ensure that action is taken in response to shareholder voting on director remuneration matters. Originality/value Representatives of asset managers and listed financial services investee companies offered valuable insights on remuneration governance deliberations in an emerging market.

10.1108/PR-03-2021-0212,"Understanding the role of job quality in the association of employees' career change to self-employment and job satisfaction. Purpose - While researchers have discussed the association between career change to self-employment and job satisfaction, few have considered how the association is achieved. Therefore, in this study, the authors aim to explain this relationship from the perspective of job quality. The authors build on job design theory to propose and empirically test how fluctuations in job satisfaction as associated with the transition to self-employment can be explained by changes in job quality. Design/methodology/approach - The authors tested their propositions using a longitudinal, nationally representative database from Australia for the 2005-2019 period. The final sample included 108,384 observations from 18,755 employees. Findings - In line with the literature, the authors found that job incumbents experienced low job satisfaction in the years prior to their career change to self-employment and that their job satisfaction improved after the transition. More importantly, the authors found the same change pattern for job quality - measured as job autonomy and skill variety - and the statistical results demonstrated that job quality was the key determinant of job satisfaction during the process. Practical implications - This study advocates the importance of job quality in managing employee wellbeing and facilitating retention. Originality/value - The authors contribute to the literature by uncovering how job quality, represented by skill variety and job autonomy, can explain fluctuations in job satisfaction during individuals' career change from paid employment to self-employment.",art

Purpose The rich qualitative study builds on 11 semi-structured interviews with nine neurodivergent employees and two business professionals supportive of neurodiversity to understand the lived experiences of dealing with crisis in a remote working environment. Design/methodology/approach The purpose of the reported research is to understand how neurominorities experience remote working in the times of crisis and what the implications of this are for human resource (HR) professionals. Findings Moving to remote work resulted in a lack of routine, distractions and working long hours, which can all be difficult for line managers to monitor. Further problems with communication in a virtual environment and lack of understanding by others were found to be particularly burdensome to neurodivergent individuals. On the positive note, remote working in the times of crisis allowed for avoiding sensory overwhelm and was seen as an important step in creating a healthy work-life balance (WLB). Practical implications The findings of this study point HR practitioners' attention towards building a more neurodiversity friendly post-pandemic workplace and prompt employers to offer working arrangements, which better suit employees' domestic and personal circumstances. Originality/value This study addresses the lack of research on the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on neurominorities. In doing so, it answers recent calls to move away from universal HR as a route to positive employee outcomes and facilitates a more accurate reflection of organizational reality for disadvantaged members of society.",art
10.1108/PR-02-2021-0109,"A multilevel model of abusive supervision climate. Purpose Abusive supervision climate (ASC) affects not only direct subordinates of abusive supervisors but also their colleagues who work in the same group. Therefore, this study aims to examine the underlying processes and boundary conditions of ASC's effects on group members' behaviors. Design/methodology/approach The study collected data from 213 employees in 51 workgroups across 13 organizations in Pakistan. Data were analyzed in MPlus version 8 (Muthen and Muthen, 1998-2017) using a random intercepts multilevel model. The authors followed the procedures for testing 2-1-1 mediation with a participant-level mediator as outlined in Pituch and Stapleton (2012). Findings The results revealed that anger mediated the negative relationship between ASC and group members' organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs), as well as the positive relationship between ASC and group members' withdrawal. In addition, agreeableness moderated the effect of group members' anger on OCBs, such that the relationship was stronger for more agreeable group members. Originality/value The findings contribute to the abusive supervision literature by elucidating anger as one mechanism through which ASC affects group members and by incorporating personality differences to better understand group members' behavioral responses.",art

PurposeWe integrate trait, individual differences and substitutes for leadership theories to examine how leader trait anger influences leader vision and follower trust in the leader across high versus low levels of organizational formalization.Design/methodology/approachWe obtained data from two independent multi-source samples from different occupations and countries. Sample 1: leader-follower dyads (n = 179) collected over three measurement periods from the Philippines; Sample 2: cross-correlational sample of leaders (n = 166), their manager (n = 166) and their followers (n = 610) from Australia.FindingsWe tested our hypotheses using PROCESS (Hayes, 2018) and found that leader trait anger influenced follower trust in the leader both directly and indirectly through leader vision (Samples 1 & 2). We also found that organizational formalization neutralized the effect of leader vision on follower trust in the leader (Sample 2).Research limitations/implicationsWhile we used a time-lagged design in Sample 1, we cannot make strong causal claims as might be the case in an experimental study, for example.Practical implicationsOur results highlight the adverse effect of leader trait anger on perceptions of leader vision and follower trust in the leader, which we suggest should be considered in recruitment and promotion decisions. Our findings also suggest that high levels of organizational formalization may undermine the motivational effect of leader vision on followers, which should be considered in relation to organizational rules and procedures.Originality/valueThis research enhances our understanding of a previously unexplored boundary condition (i.e. organizational formalization) that appears to neutralize the motivational effect of leader vision. In addition, it highlights the ubiquitous effect of trait anger, in this case undermining the effectiveness of leader vision and trust in the leader, from two different observer perspectives (i.e. leaders' followers and managers).",art
10.1108/PR-08-2023-0685,"The role of family support on the effects of paramedic role overload on resilience, intention to leave and promotive voice. PurposeParamedics have played a critical role in the health care system response to the COVID-19 pandemic as frontline responders. However, in comparison to other health care workers (i.e. nurses), less research has been conducted on how paramedic work has been undertaken and how they manage their resources in the context of high workloads. This study examines several factors that deplete paramedic resources as well as the importance of family support in buffering the effects of low levels of resilience that can impact paramedic intention to leave and promotive voice.Design/methodology/approachData were collected from 648 paramedics employed by Ambulance Victoria, Australia, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examine five hypotheses: (1) resilience mediates the relationship between role overload and intention to leave; (2) resilience mediates the relationship between role overload and promotive voice; (3) family support moderates the relationship between role overload and resilience; (4) family support moderates the indirect effect of role overload on intention to leave via resilience and (5) family support moderates the indirect effect of role overload on promotive voice via resilience.FindingsWe found that when family support was low, the impact of role overload on turnover intention via resilience was significant. When family support was low, the negative impact of role overload on promotive voice via resilience was significant. When family support was high, such a negative indirect effect was not significant in predicting employee promotive voice via resilience.Practical implicationsWe suggest that organisations should focus human resource management (HRM) policies and practices on family-friendly initiatives to further enhance family support resources to benefit individuals, families and organisations.Originality/valueOur findings demonstrate the importance of family support as a buffer to the negative effects of role overload on employee resilience and promotive voice. There is clear importance of the contextual elements of family support as a resource, and its absence may result in resource depletion and can act as a catalyst in a resource depletion spiral. This demonstrates the importance of organisations understanding and learning to utilise external resources to complement organisational and individual resources to reduce intention to leave and support promotive employee voice. We suggest that organisations should focus HRM policies and practices on family-friendly initiatives to further enhance family support resources to benefit individuals, families and organisations.",art

PurposeThe purpose of this study is to investigate the negative spillover effects of family incivility on employees' ability to meet their work-related deadlines. Furthermore, we examine emotional exhaustion as a mediator and emotional intelligence as a moderator in this process.Design/methodology/approachWe test our predictions through a multisource, time-separated data collection involving 161 employee-supervisor dyads working in various hospitality sector organizations in Pakistan - a relatively understudied context where the hospitality industry is struggling.FindingsThe findings of our study indicate that exposure to rude family behavior hinders employees' ability to complete work tasks on time, as mediated by their emotional exhaustion. However, this harmful process can be curtailed if employees can rely on their emotional intelligence to regulate their own emotions and those of their family members.Practical implicationsThe findings of this study provide pertinent insights for HR managers and organizations to help their employees deal with family issues. Moreover, organizations can benefit from introducing training programs that improve employees' emotional intelligence and increase the likelihood that they do not default on their work deadlines.Originality/valueThis study extends the limited existing family incivility research by investigating its spillover effects on employees' ability to meet work deadlines, a previously unexplored relationship.

PurposeThe aim of this study is to analyze the differences between non-standard forms of employment (FoE) (i.e. dependent self-employment/business-to-business/B2B contract and contract of mandate) in terms of investing in the development of future competencies by employees and employers. This study also examined additional factors which influence these investments.Design/methodology/approachTo collect data, the computer-assisted telephone interview technique was used. 200 employees from different companies located in Poland participated in this study, wherein each of the above-mentioned FoEs (i.e. dependent self-employment and contract of mandate) was represented by 100 people. The Chi-Square test and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used in the statistical analyses.FindingsIn the case of only 2 out of 14 competencies, there were statistically significant differences between the two groups of respondents: the employers financed training courses for B2B employees more frequently than for mandate contract workers. Moreover, in only one case there was a statistically significant difference: the self-employed financed training courses themselves more often than mandate contract workers. This study revealed an important impact of other variables such as respondents' age, education level, parental status and industry on the training activities undertaken by employers and employees.Originality/valueAlthough the issue of developing future competencies is important, there is little research examining this problem in the context of people who work in non-standard FoE. Moreover, previous research primarily focused on identifying differences between people working under employment contracts and the self-employed. This article fills these research gaps as well as shows that more factors should be considered in the research models to get a deeper insight into the problem of non-standard FoEs.",art

Purpose The authors tested (1) the mediating role of thriving in the association between leader-member exchange (LMX) and work-nonwork balance (WNWB) and (2) the moderating effect of gender in the relationship between LMX and thriving. Design/methodology/approach Cross-sectional data were collected from six separate participant groups across an eight-month period (n = 522). Data analysis included confirmatory factor analysis to assess the construct validity of the proposed three-factor model. Hierarchical regression and the PROCESS macro were used to test three hypotheses. Findings The authors found thriving mediated an indirect effect of LMX on WNWB. In addition, we found that the relationship between LMX and thriving was moderated by gender, such that the relationship was found for females. Overall, the authors identified a moderated-mediation effect indicating an indirect effect of LMX on WNWB via thriving for females. Research limitations/implications Cross-sectional design suggests their results are theory driven. The authors suggest future studies replicate the study employing experimental designs. Practical implications The authors suggest organisations develop programs to enhance leadership and thriving capabilities as tools to manage WNWB. Originality/value The authors add to the thriving literature by revealing gender differences in the effectiveness of relational resources (i.e. LMX) in fostering employee thriving. Furthermore, the authors extend the efficacy of thriving beyond the workplace to include WNWB.

Purpose Building on the arguments of expectancy theory and social exchange theory, the present study provides insights into the process by which pay-for-performance (PFP) impacts employee job performance. Design/methodology/approach Based on a sample size of 226 employees working in a technology company in India, the study examines the relationships between PFP, procedural justice, organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and employee job performance. Data on perceptions of PFP and procedural justice were collected from the employees, data on OCB were collected from the supervisors and the data on employee job performance were collected from organizational appraisal records. Findings The study found support for the positive relationship between PFP and job performance and for the sequential mediation of the relationship between PFP and job performance via procedural justice and OCB. Further, procedural justice was found to mediate the relationship between PFP and OCB. Research limitations/implications The study was cross-sectional, so inferences about causality are limited. Practical implications The study tests the relationship between PFP and employee job performance in the Indian work context. The study shows that the existence of PFP is positively related to procedural justice which, in turn, is positively related to OCB. The study found support for the sequential mediation of PFP-job performance relationship via procedural justice and OCB.

Purpose This study investigated the mediating role of job satisfaction and the moderating role of career growth opportunity in the relationship between public service motivation (PSM) and public employees' turnover intention. Design/methodology/approach The authors recruited 587 public employees from Yunnan Province, China to test moderation and mediation hypotheses. The authors conducted confirmatory factor analysis to determine the discriminant and convergent validity of the measures of PSM, turnover intention, job satisfaction and career growth opportunity. Finally, the authors carried out bootstrapping to ascertain direct, indirect and conditional indirect effects. Findings PSM had a negative effect on public employees' turnover intention, but this relationship was partially mediated by job satisfaction. Career growth opportunity moderated the association between job satisfaction and turnover intention. In particular, the indirect effect of PSM on turnover intention through job satisfaction weakened under high career growth opportunities. Practical implications The results highlighted the significance of PSM and career growth opportunity in shaping public employees' work-related attitudes and behaviors. Public organizations should consider PSM a key criterion in recruitment and selection and pay more attention to the significance of intervening in career growth to satisfy public employees' psychological needs related to individual career development. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature on the disputed link between PSM and turnover intention and uncovered the underlying mechanism through which PSM affects public employees' turnover intention by proposing job satisfaction and career growth opportunity as a mediator and moderator, respectively.",art

Purpose Recent studies on contingent workers highlight their boundaryless and protean nature, and depict them as free agents who reject organisational forms of career support. Going beyond such current view, this paper aims to shed light on the career support provided by labour market intermediaries (LMIs) to skilled contingent workers (SCWs), the latter known as freelancers and consulting firms' employees. Design/methodology/approach Using a qualitative stance and an inductive approach, the authors draw on 33 interviews to grasp SCWs' discourses on the career support offered by LMIs, and their account managers. The thematic analysis reveals two main themes: the career support delivered by LMIs to SCWs, and the expectations of SCWs regarding potential additional forms of career support from LMIs. Findings The authors show that SCWs are supported by LMIs in their career via a number of career management practices and operational support, and account managers a likely to play a key role in the careers of SCWs by providing transactional and relational career support. Moreover, the authors stress that SCWs are free agents, yet seeking for forms of support from LMIs. Originality/value The present paper addresses the roles of LMIs regarding non-standard population of workers through the lens of SCWs, what has barely been undertaken in recent research. This paper also enriches current debates on the organisational support SCWs are willing to accept and benefit from, despite the idiosyncratic nature of their careers.",art

Purpose Although flexible work arrangements (FWAs) are widely regarded as a desirable employee benefit, questions remain about which factors drive (or attenuate) applicant attraction to them. The authors offer a novel theoretical account by advancing the concept of lay theories (i.e. mindsets) around an individual's ability to juggle work and life responsibilities, defined as beliefs that the ability to juggle is either malleable (i.e. growth) or cannot be changed (i.e. fixed), which suggests greater efficacy increases attraction. Design/methodology/approach Utilizing an experimental policy-capturing design, 86 participants each rated a series of 64 job offers (N = 5,376) with several manipulated job attributes. Participants were randomly assigned into a growth or fixed mindset condition. Findings Multilevel regressions revealed that a growth (vs fixed) mindset caused participants to place greater weight on flexible work scheduling policies by reporting greater attraction to jobs with flexible arrangements. Practical implications Organizations may increase applicant attraction by taking steps to ensure that the value of work-life benefits is salient, such as offering concrete examples of how policies have been used. Originality/value This study questions the assumption that those who need flexibility are more attracted to FWAs and demonstrates that beliefs around one's ability to juggle work-life demands are a unique mechanism shaping applicant attraction.",art

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study how the interplay of the emotion of fear and the personality trait of resilience affect time to reemployment after job termination. The authors carried out the research by extending affective events theory (AET) beyond the workplace. Design/methodology/approach This paper is a conceptual paper intended to lay the groundwork for future analysis in the areas of fear and resilience, specifically in the time after job termination. Findings The paper suggests that fear is a natural response to job termination, and there are two responses to fear: one of action to rid oneself of fear (fight or flight) and one of paralysis, in which an individual remains in a fear state. The authors put forth that one's level of resilience is a factor in determining time to reemployment. Originality/value While there are numerous studies on the role emotions play in the workplace and in particular, the role of fear about potentially getting fired, there are few, if any, studies on the role of fear after losing a job. The authors feel this is a warranted area of study as fear can have both positive and negative responses. The authors also contend that a major diver of these fear responses is an individual's level of resilience, and this can be a significant predictor of the individual's time to reemployment.",art

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to address assumptions about the prevalence of change in human resource management (HRM) and organizational change literature, providing evidence from employee perceptions across three countries. The results indicate change was commonplace even before the pandemic disruptions of 2020. Design/methodology/approach Given this study's exploratory, employee perspective, a cross-sectional self-report survey was used. Three survey panel samples were collected in 2017: US (n = 718), Australia (n = 501) and New Zealand (n = 516). Analysis of variance was used to test whether the prevalence of change differed significantly between countries or specific groups of employees. An analysis of comments on change types and emotional response provides further insights. Findings The paper provides evidence of the ubiquity of change: 73% of employees are experiencing change at work and 42% perceived it as moderate to massive, with little variation between countries. Employees commonly experience more than one change, with those experiencing large amounts of change reporting predominantly negative emotional impacts. Research limitations/implications The research provides a snapshot across three countries during a prosperous and relatively stable period, providing a point of comparison for the turbulent times we have faced in 2020 as the publication date will be 2021 the current text may not work as well. Since change can be arduous, the authors recommend that HRM researchers consider change prevalence as a contextual factor, and practitioners heed employee reactions to change, particularly during periods of significant change.

Purpose This study aims to investigate the possible negativity of job embeddedness in developing countries. Operationally, the study aimed to configure the relationship between job embeddedness and cyberloafing with respect to both contextual (job satisfaction) and individual (internet addiction) factors. Design/methodology/approach Incorporating the conservation of resources theory and reactance theory into the theory of job embeddedness, the present study adopted a resource-based approach to job embeddedness to examine its main and moderated effects on cyberloafing in a three-way interaction model. With the focus on public organizations, 500 administrative employees from an Iranian university were surveyed using self-reporting measures, and the collected data were analyzed using partial least squares-structural equation modeling and hierarchical moderated multiple regression. Findings As predicted, job embeddedness was positively associated with cyberloafing; however, in contrast with predictions, job satisfaction had no inverse impact on the job embeddedness-cyberloafing relationship, and its role was limited to neutralizing the increasing effect of internet addiction. Practical implications Consideration should be given to how job embeddedness interacts with contextual and individual moderators to affect cyberloafing. In particular, this study implicated some practical procedures to provide employees with on- and off-the-job resources and avoid fighting over the organization's resources. Additionally, this study provides insights into embeddedness-satisfaction interplay to provide employees with propitious work conditions in line with organizational productivity. Originality/value There is little research on the association between job embeddedness and counterproductive work behaviors, and the findings are inconsistent. A review of the literature revealed no study addressing cyberloafing implications of job embeddedness. This study expands the literature by theoretically and empirically correlating job embeddedness and cyberloafing in a non-western developing country. Accordingly, the significance of this study is its capability in mitigating cyberloafing behaviors by promoting the adverse job embeddedness.",art

Purpose - Based on affective events theory, this research attempted to investigate how negative gossip about organizational change drives employees to experience negative emotions and direct their aggression toward customers. Design/methodology/approach - We conducted a scenario-based experiment (Study 1) and a multiwave field survey (Study 2) to test our hypotheses. Findings - The results show that (1) negative emotions mediate the relationship between change-related negative gossip and displaced aggression toward customers; (2) perceived organizational constraints strengthen the relationship between change-related negative gossip and negative emotions; (3) future work self-salience weakens the relationship between change-related negative gossip and negative emotions; and (4) change-related negative gossip has a strengthened (weakened) indirect effect on displaced aggression via negative emotions when employees have high perceived organizational constraints (future work self-salience).

Purpose - This paper aims to enhance our understanding of how organizational dehumanization affects employees' creative performance. We propose the self-esteem threat as a mediator in the relationship between organizational dehumanization and employees' creative performance. We also examine how work locus of control moderates the relationship between organizational dehumanization and creative performance. Design/methodology/approach - Through convenience sampling, online and face-to-face surveys, multisource time-lagged data (N = 257) were collected from full-time employees and their supervisors in Pakistani organizations in the information technology, media industry and oil and gas sectors. Findings - Organizational dehumanization negatively affects employees' creative performance, and threats to self-esteem mediate this relationship. Work locus of control moderates the effect of organizational dehumanization on creative performance, and this negative relationship is attenuated when individuals have an external work locus of control. Originality/value - This study provides novel insights into the process underlying the relationship between organizational dehumanization and creative performance by revealing the mediating role of threat to self-esteem and the buffering role of work locus of control.",art

It also reports the first meta-analytic examination of longer-term effects (beyond the immediate post-intervention period). Design/methodology/approach - This meta-analysis followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines and utilised the methodologies of Hunter and Schmidt (2004) and Borenstein et al. (2009). The search period was from 2006 until February 2023. A total of 40 studies (N 5 4,207) were included in the meta-analyses. The analyses were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) Version 4 software programme. Findings - The results indicate that the impacts of interventions on PsyCap and each of its component resources are greater than those reported in a previous meta-analysis (Lupsa et al., 2020), with the strongest impacts on hope and optimism. Interventions had sustained positive effects on PsyCap, hope, resilience and optimism, but not efficacy, and the frequency of intervention sessions influenced the effectiveness of interventions on hope, efficacy and optimism. Interestingly, specific PsyCap-focussed interventions did not have the greatest impact on PsyCap or its component resources. Originality/value - This study contributes to emerging research on wellbeing-oriented HRM and provides valuable insights into more effective design and implementation of interventions to enhance PsyCap and its component resources. These interventions are a promising form of investment in employees which may bring mutual gains for individuals and organisations. The present findings extend those of previous studies and specifically respond to the call for further research on the persistence of PsyCap intervention effects.",art

PurposeThis study investigates human resource (HR) professionals' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic.Design/methodology/approachThe study involves in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 37 HR professionals purposefully selected based on their prior involvement in managing pandemic-related challenges.FindingsThe findings reveal that HR professionals faced intensified organizational demands, leading to expanded job roles, increased workload, a change in pace and emotional pressures. However, participants exhibited resilience by drawing from and creating various job resources to cope with these demands. Our findings also show that despite HR professionals being central to creating workplace support and wellness initiatives, their well-being needs were often overlooked as they prioritized supporting others.Research limitations/implicationsThe study contributes to research on the experiences of HR professionals during the pandemic and to job-demands resources (JD-R) theory by incorporating context-specific demands, resources and coping strategies specific to HR professionals.Practical implicationsLessons learned for organizations and HR professionals are discussed in relation to creating conditions of organizational support and resource availability for HR professionals.Originality/valueThis study extends research on the mental health and well-being of HR professionals during the pandemic by providing a novel lens on linkages between job demands, job resources and self-regulation strategies.",art

PurposeResearch suggests that engaging in networking behaviors can affect individual work outcomes. However, relatively less is known about how internal versus external networking behaviors influence work outcomes, and whether gender moderates these relationships. Drawing on social capital theory and social role theory, the authors propose a positive relationship between employees' internal and external networking behaviors and their work outcomes (job commitment and career success), and the moderating effect of gender. The authors also explore employee preference in networking.Design/methodology/approachBased on a sequential mixed-method research design with a four-month time lag, Study 1 data on networking behaviors and employee outcomes were collected via a survey of middle managers and their supervisors from 10 private sector organizations in Sri Lanka. Study 2 data were collected via interviews from a sample of those middle managers and their supervisors.FindingsStudy 1 findings indicate a positive relationship between internal networking behaviors and job commitment, and external networking behaviors and career success. The authors also found that internal networking behaviors enhance job commitment. Study 2 findings indicate men and women network differently and benefit differently from that networking but achieve equitable workplace benefits.Originality/valueThis study provides pioneering evidence that internal networking behaviors enhance job commitment among women. It appears that past research did not test the moderating effect of gender for internal versus external networking behaviors separately. Moreover, this study refines the evidence that internal and external networking behaviors differentially impact employee outcomes and explains the processes through a qualitative inquiry.",art
10.1108/PR-07-2022-0470,"Transformational leadership, idiosyncratic deals and employee outcomes. PurposeTransformational leadership (TFL) has been suggested to create positive changes in employees with the goal of developing them into leaders. The authors integrate this well-established leadership style with recent research on idiosyncratic deals (i-deals). The authors suggest TFL as a predictor of task and development-based i-deals, and propose i-deals as a mediating mechanism linking TFL to employee outcomes (job satisfaction, job stress and manager-rated performance).Design/methodology/approachThe authors used a time-lagged research design, and collected four waves of data from 140 employees and 78 leaders.FindingsTFL was found to be an important predictor of i-deals. I-deals predicted job satisfaction and job stress; and it mediated the relationship between TFL and these two employee outcomes. Yet, i-deals were not associated with employee performance and did not mediate the relationship.Originality/valueFirst, it shows that transformational leaders who consider employees' unique skills and support their professional growth are more likely to grant personalized arrangements. Second, drawing from social exchange theory, it illustrates that i-deals may act as a linkage between TFL and employee outcomes. The paper bridges leadership and i-deals literature to identify key leverage points through which leaders can enhance employee satisfaction, well-being and performance.",art

PurposeThe authors aim to explore how perspective-taking and attribution of blame lead to side-taking by human resource professionals (HRPs) when making judgements and handling complaints of sexual harassment.Design/methodology/approachEmploying qualitative methodology, the authors used semi-structured in-depth interviews with 35 HRPs from 30 companies in Sri Lanka. Attribution theory and perspective-taking were used as theoretical lenses.FindingsIn handling complaints of sexual harassment incidents, HRPs take the perspectives of the alleged perpetrator, complainant, or the company and attribute the blame to the alleged perpetrator or the complainant. Irrespective of the gender of the HRPs and the perspective they take, they would most often blame the female complainants due to sexual harassment myths and misperceptions and traditional sex-role beliefs. Thus, they either take the side of the alleged perpetrator or the company, explicitly/implicitly or intentionally/unintentionally.Originality/valueThe central originality of this research is the finding that HRPs take sides in resolving complaints of sexual harassment and perspective-taking and attribution of blame by HRPs lead to this side-taking in organisational settings.",art

Purpose Authenticity, or the extent to which individuals act in accordance with their values, beliefs and characteristics, is recognized as a key component of a fulfilled life. However, little is known about its antecedents in an organizational context. Drawing on goal-setting theory and the broaden-and-build theory, the current study examined the role of team leaders' perceived shared vision in promoting their work authenticity, mediated through strengths use support (SUS) for members as well as leaders' strengths use. Design/methodology/approach A two-wave questionnaire survey was conducted to test the hypotheses using a sample of 325 middle managers of a manufacturing firm. Findings The results of structural equation modeling show that perceived shared vision promoted work authenticity, mediated through SUS and strengths use. Originality/value This study is the first to identify that shared goals can trigger authenticity at work by directing the leader to use their strengths, alongside their team members.",art
10.1108/PR-02-2022-0176,"An empirical analysis of facilitators and barriers to the hybrid work model: a cross-cultural and multi-theoretical approach. Purpose This paper examines the influence of facilitators and barriers on employees' preference to work in a hybrid model. The study uses the theoretical lens of stimulus-organism-response (SOR) and dual factor theory (DFT). It examines the influence of health consciousness (stimulus), facilitators (e.g. work flexibility, work-life balance and team building) (organism) and barriers (e.g. pandemic and travel stressor and role overload [organism] on employees' preference to work in a hybrid model) (response). Further, it tests the moderating influence of organizational culture. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was conducted among employees in India, Sri Lanka and Germany, obtaining 281 usable questionnaires. Structural equation modeling (SEM) using Warp PLS 7.0 was used as the analytical technique to examine the model fit and test hypotheses. Findings The findings reveal that health consciousness is essential in enhancing facilitators and motivating employees to prefer a hybrid working model. The study's findings also prove the positive influence of work flexibility, work-life balance and team building as facilitators. The results suggest that pandemic and travel stressors inhibit employees' preference for working in a hybrid model. Research limitations/implications The study is based on a cross-sectional research design to generalise the findings. Future researchers can utilize longitudinal design to decipher the variation in response over time. The study has developed a model combining SOR with DFT; the authors suggest that future researchers use other theories in combination with SOR, like self-determination theory (SDT), to decipher the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation of employees in the context of the hybrid working model. Practical implications This study identifies the need for open communication with the employees to overcome their concerns regarding the hybrid working model. The study also suggests that human resource (HR) managers need to prioritize the task that needs to be accomplished from the office versus working from home. The authors recommend various measures, like water cooler breaks and a buddy system, to motivate employees to work in a hybrid model. Originality/value This study is among the first studies focused on the hybrid working model. The current study adds to the limited literature on the facilitators and barriers of working in a hybrid work model.",art

Purpose This research aims to focus on the environmentally specific transformational leadership (ETFL) of a chief executive officer (CEO) and aims to examine the effect of CEOs' ETFL on firm's proactive environmental strategies (PESs), by indicating the top management team's (TMT) green commitment as a mediator and regulative pressure as a moderator to understand the relation. Design/methodology/approach This study used multisource data from 170 small-to medium-sized manufacturing firms in China. Findings The results indicated that CEOs' ETFL was positively related to the TMT's green commitment, which, in turn, enhanced the firm's PESs. Moreover, regulative pressure strengthened the direct effect of CEOs' ETFL on their TMTs' green commitment and the indirect effect of CEOs' ETFL on the firm's PESs via TMTs' green commitment. Originality/value The tested importance of regulative pressure as an external condition that strengthens the effectiveness of CEOs' ETFL offers new theoretical insights to advance the literature on PESs.",art

Purpose Drawing on the socially embedded model of thriving at work, this study aims to test a moderated mediation model to elucidate the mediating effect of work meaningfulness and the moderating role of perceived interpersonal justice on the relationship between servant leadership and thriving at work. Design/methodology/approach Based on a sample of 221 employees from the manufacturing industry in South Korea, a series of hierarchical regression analyses were conducted by using statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) software. For conducting moderated mediation analysis, the PROCESS macro for SPSS was utilized. Findings The findings show that servant leadership significantly relates to thriving at work, and work meaningfulness and perceived interpersonal justice act as a mediating mechanism and a boundary condition, respectively. Based on moderated mediation analysis, the collective effect of servant leadership, work meaningfulness and perceived interpersonal justice on thriving at work were also confirmed. Practical implications The findings suggest that organizations should adopt servant leadership to promote employee thriving at work. In doing so, it is important to ensure that employees experience work meaningfulness, and are treated with respect and dignity. Originality/value This study extends research on servant leadership, and sheds light on important mechanisms and boundary conditions under which servant leadership promotes thriving at work.",art
10.1108/PR-04C321-0234,"Benevolent leadership and organizational citizenship behaviors in a higher education context: a moderated mediation model. Purpose - Drawing upon the conservation of resources (COR) theory, this paper investigates the moderated mediation model linking benevolent leadership to organizational citizenship behaviors towards the organization (OCBO) and towards individuals (OCBI) in the context of higher education. The mediating roles of leader-member exchange and affective commitment as well as the moderating roles of the two attachment styles-attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance-are also examined.Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from a sample of 333 university lecturers and analyzed using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM).Findings - The results demonstrate that leader-member exchange and affective commitment are mediating resources that help benevolent leaders motivate university lecturers to engage in two types of OCBs. Moreover, attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance act as the respective enhancer and inhibitor for the indirect effects of benevolent leadership on both OCBs through leader-member exchange. In contrast, the relationships between benevolent leadership and two types of OCBs through the mediating role of affective commitment are not contingent on the attachment styles of lecturers.Practical implications - The findings suggest that university leaders who aim at promoting OCBs among lecturers should deploy benevolent leadership style to facilitate a positive social exchange relationship as well as foster their affective commitment. Such leadership style is especially effective in influencing lecturers who possess attachment anxiety personality traits.Originality/value - This pioneer research develops and empirically tests a COR theory-grounded moderated mediation model pertaining to benevolent leadership and lecturers' OCBs. The findings contribute to the educational management literature by demonstrating that benevolent leadership, a crucial organizational resource, significantly motivates lecturers' voluntary and extra-role behaviors in a dynamic and contingent manner. Leader-member exchange and affective commitment are important mediating resources in the process of transforming benevolent leadership into beneficial behaviors. Further, the effectiveness of benevolent leadership largely depends on lecturers' personality traits of attachment anxiety and avoidance. These novel mediating and moderating findings demonstrate the sequential and interaction effects of various organizational and individual resources on lecturers' OCBs; thus, adding value to the COR theory's core principles, including resource caravans and resource investment behaviors.",art

Purpose This work is an extension of research on worker participation in achieving career success by including a prominent contextual construct, that is social capital. The present research aims to study how competency development influences the intrinsic career success of females in the handicraft industry, by considering the role of perceived employability as a mediator and social capital as a moderator. By doing so, this paper aims to fill the vacuum in the career literature that suggests that career success is not gender neutral. Design/methodology/approach Data was collected from handicraft workers by adopting the survey method. CFA and SPSS macro named PROCESS were used to analyse data. Findings Competency development influences the subjective career success of female workers, and perceived employability mediated the relationship between them. Moreover, social capital independently moderates the relationship between the participation of workers in competency development and perceived employability. Research limitations/implications The study is conducted in the Indian context alone, and therefore future studies must be conducted globally to deepen the scholarly dialogue on female workers' career success. Also, the current study measures career success, from a subjective perspective, thus future studies can measure female workers' objective career success. Practical implications The current paper identifies the need to study the factors contributing to female workers' career success in small industries. Social implications Conventional industries and their workers' career success must be given equal importance by researchers, practitioners and policymakers. Originality/value The paper fills the gap in career research by exploring female workers' career success through empirical evidence.",art
10.1108/PR-04-2021-0294,"Does intraorganizational competition prompt or hinder performance? The risks for proactive employees who hide knowledge. Purpose This study examines whether employees' perceptions of intraorganizational competition, defined as beliefs that the organization evaluates their performance in comparison with others, result in lower supervisor ratings of their conscientiousness if the employees, particularly those with proactive personalities, respond to the resource-draining, competitive work situation with knowledge hiding behavior. Design/methodology/approach Multisource data were collected from employees and supervisors in different industries at three points in time. The research hypotheses were tested with hierarchical multiple regression analysis, in combination with PROCESS macro-based bootstrapping, to assess mediation and moderated mediation. Findings Beliefs about highly competitive organizational climates are counterproductive, in that they lead employees to conceal knowledge intentionally from other organizational members. This mediating role of knowledge concealment is particularly prominent among employees with a strong desire to take the initiative to protect themselves against the hardships created by a climate of internal competition. Research limitations/implications The research design does not allow for formal tests of causality. Practical implications For human resource managers, this research pinpoints self-protective knowledge hiding as a key, detrimental mechanism. It imposes dual harms: employees feel threatened by the strict performance-oriented climate, and their defensive reactions make them appear less conscientious to supervisors. This downward spiral is particularly likely to initiate among employees who exhibit a disposition toward action. Originality/value This research investigates novel connections between specific organizational elements and outcomes, by specifying why and when employees' beliefs about performance-oriented organizational climates might backfire, due to their negative behavioral responses, such as purposeful knowledge hiding.",art

Purpose Based on the conservation of resource (COR) theory, this study investigates the association between the perception of organizational politics and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) while considering the mediating role of knowledge hiding and moderating role of political skill in this process. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected in a time-lagged survey in two waves with a three-week interval from frontline employees and their peers working in private sector banks in India. The hypothesized relationships were ascertained using the PROCESS macro for SPSS. Findings The results revealed a negative association between the perception of organizational politics and OCBs targeted at co-workers (OCBI), organization (OCBO) and customers (OCBC), both directly and indirectly, via knowledge hiding. Additionally, the negative indirect effect of the perception of organizational politics on OCB facets, via knowledge hiding, is buffered for individuals with high levels of political skill.

10.1108/PR-03-2021-0223,"Formalization and employee thriving at work: a moderated mediation model including work engagement and centralization. Purpose Until recently, scholars have begun to examine the contextual antecedents of employees thriving at work. A recent study has shown that one aspect of organizational structure/context (i.e. formalization) can be an important antecedent of employee thriving at work. However, scholars have urged doing research examining how different aspects of organizational structure can combinedly influence employee work outcomes such as thriving at work. Given that, the present paper proposes a theoretical model to unravel the mechanisms of how two aspects of organizational structure (i.e. formalization and centralization) may operate as the antecedents of employees thriving at work. In particular, the author draws on the Conservation of Resources Theory (COR) to hypothesize that employees' work engagement mediates the relationship between their perception of formalization and thriving at work. The author further hypothesizes that the indirect relationship between formalization and employee thriving at work is moderated by employees' perception of centralization, such that the relationship is stronger in the presence of a lower level of centralization than higher. Design/methodology/approach The author gathered data by employing a time-lagged survey design involving 136 full-time employees from different organizations. Findings Results show that employee work engagement mediates the relationship between formalization and employee thriving at work. Further, the indirect relationship between formalization and employee thriving at work is stronger when the level of centralization is relatively low. Research limitations/implications Formalization is able to enact employees' thriving at work, particularly when organization implements relatively less centralized structure. Originality/value This study first introduces work engagement as a mediator in the formalization-employee thriving at work relationship and centralization as a moderator along this mediating process.",art

Purpose The purpose of this article is to advance the understanding of expatriates' psychological attachment toward both their parent company and its foreign subsidiary by highlighting how workplace friendships enhance the process of adjustment for expatriates and how these effects on adjustment subsequently translate into expatriates' dual commitment. Design/methodology/approach Hypotheses were tested using a sample of 187 expatriates, working in managerial positions, in subsidiaries of multinational corporations, all of whom were assigned expatriates. Serial multiple indirect effects were tested. Findings The results indicated that the relationship between workplace friendships and interaction adjustment was supported, but the relationship between workplace friendships and work adjustment was not supported. The serial indirect effects of international adjustment and work adjustment on the relationship between interaction adjustment and expatriates' dual commitment were supported. Originality/value This study seeks to fill a gap in the research literature on expatriates by focusing on the issue of workplace friendships and expatriates' dual commitment. The findings help bolster the literature on relational schemas in that expatriates' workplace friendships establish scripts for expatriates' expected outlines of adjustment in work domains. This study also provides insights relevant to the literature on social interaction and adjustment, as the findings support our theory that expatriate commitment is not directly contingent on workplace friendships but rather on the mediating roles of both interaction adjustment and work adjustment.",art

Purpose Moral leadership is a common leadership style in Chinese society and is of great significance to Chinese organizations. Unethical employee behavior also widely exists in all kinds of social organizations and brings great harm. The research on the relationship between moral leadership and unethical employee behavior has not been involved yet, but it is important. This paper studies how moral manager (senior leader) leadership trickles down to unethical employee behavior through moral supervisor (employee direct supervisor) leadership, and discusses the moderating effect of LMX and ethical climate. Design/methodology/approach Through the questionnaire survey of 406 pairs of leaders and employees, and use multilevel path analysis, we test the hypothesis in this paper. Findings The research results show that (1) Moral manager leadership is negatively related to unethical employee behavior. (2) Moral supervisor leadership mediates the relationship between moral manager leadership and unethical employee behavior. (3) LMX positively moderates the relationship between moral manager leadership and moral supervisor leadership, and moderates the mediating effect of moral supervisor leadership. (4) Ethical climate positively moderates the relationship between moral supervisor leadership and unethical employee behavior, and moderates the mediating effect of moral supervisor leadership. Originality/value First, this study further proves that moral leadership is a popular positive leadership among the three dimensions of paternalistic leadership that extends its influence to unethical employee behavior. Second, this study traces the source of the moral leadership of employees' supervisors and reveals the action mechanism of how moral manager leadership affects unethical employee behavior.

Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between perception of training, organizational commitment and organizational citizenship behavior. Moreover, the study examines the moderating role of power distance on the relationship between perception of training and organizational commitment. Design/methodology/approach Using stratified sampling technique, the data were obtained from 379 employees working at branches of public and private banks located in five metropolitan cities in Pakistan. To test the established hypotheses, structural equation modeling technique was adopted using Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) 21.0. Findings The findings stated a significant relationship between perception of training and organizational citizenship behavior, but there was no relationship found between perception of training and organizational commitment. Moreover, organizational commitment partly mediated the relationship between perception of training and organizational citizenship behavior. The results also described that power distance moderates the relationship between perception of training and organizational commitment. Practical implications The results of the study can be beneficial for banking sector and strategy makers who have extended vision and anticipate organizational citizenship behavior from their employees. The study also offers the scope and space for the prospective researchers and scholars to carry out further research. Originality/value There is extensive literature available on the relationship between perception of training, organizational commitment and organizational citizenship behavior. However, it is observed that very few studies took the opportunity to examine the moderating role of power distance on the relationship between perception of training and organizational commitment, particularly in the context of Pakistan.

Purpose Using signaling theory and the literature on psychological contracts, the authors investigate how leaders' personalities shape their followers' perceptions of the type of psychological contract formed. They also suggest that leaders' personalities impact their followers' perceived contract breach. Furthermore, the authors propose that power distance orientation in organizations acts as an important boundary condition that enhances or exacerbates the relationships between personality and contract type and personality and perceived breach. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through multiple sources in Pakistan from 456 employees employed in 102 bank branches. Multilevel moderated path analyses provided reasonably good support for our hypotheses. Findings The leaders' personalities impacted the relational contracts of their followers in the cases of extraversion and agreeableness, whereas neuroticism had a significant relationship with the followers' formation of transactional contracts. Similarly, agreeableness, neuroticism and conscientiousness had significant relationships with perceived breach. Finally, the power distance of the followers aggregated at a group level moderated the personality-contract type and personality-perceived breach relationships. Research limitations/implications This research advances understanding of psychological contracts in organizations. More specifically, it shows that the personality of leader would have profound impact on the type of contract their employees form and the likelihood that would perceive the breach of contract. Originality/value This research extends existing personality-psychological contract literature by examining the role of leaders' personalities in signaling to employees the type of contract that is formed and the perception of its breach.

Purpose The purpose of the study is to empirically test and explore the influences of abusive supervision on subordinates' job satisfaction and mental health. Specifically, the authors focus on the mediation effects of emotional labor and compare the discrepancies between surface acting and deep acting. Design/methodology/approach Time-lagged data were obtained from 239 employees in the hospitality industry in Taiwan. The hypothesized model was tested using structural equation modeling with Mplus 7.4. Findings Results showed that abusive supervision is not only negatively related to employees' job satisfaction and mental health but also positively associated with employee surface acting and negatively associated with deep acting. For mediating effects, surface acting mediates the relationships between abusive supervision and employee job satisfaction, while deep acting mediates the relationship between abusive supervision and mental health. Practical implications Abusive supervision is detrimental; it should be reduced in the workplace. Also, frontline employees can be provided with training programs to improve their deep acting strategies, which lead to better job satisfaction and mental health.

Purpose Research on the underlying mechanisms that transfer the effects of performance appraisal (PA) on employees' behaviors and intentions remains scarce. The social exchange view of performance appraisal can be a source of deeper understanding about these underlying mechanisms. This study aims to investigate how psychological empowerment (PE) and organizational commitment (OC) explain the link between performance appraisal and three important distal outcomes: voice behavior (VB), organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), and turnover intentions (TOI). Design/methodology/approach The current study utilizes two wave - two source data from a sample of 250 employees and their supervisors from private organizations in Pakistan and tested the mediation model using SMART-PLS. Findings Results demonstrated that organizational commitment mediated the effects of performance appraisal on VB, OCB, and TOI, whereas psychological empowerment mediated the effects of performance appraisal on VB and OCB. These results have significant implications for theory and practice.

PurposeWhen evaluating the efficacy of mindfulness interventions, most studies take a linear approach to explore how an intervention impacts different outcomes for individuals, and rarely is the role of intention examined. This research takes a configural approach to consider how various elements of a participant's training expectations and their experience in the training condition combine to predict increases in psychological capital.Design/methodology/approachEmployees from hospital settings were randomized into three conditions (mindfulness training, active control (Pilates), and wait-list control group) and completed surveys at three time points (baseline, post-training and three months post-training). A qualitative comparative analysis was applied to see what combinations of motivational elements were associated with increases in psychological capital.FindingsWe find that all three conditions can boost their psychological capital based on different configurations involving efficacy beliefs, baseline states of well-being (psychological capital and perceived stress) and changes in levels of mindfulness and perceived stress.Research limitations/implicationsIndividual characteristics, like motivation, expectancy and baseline needs, are an important consideration in addition to the training condition itself when determining whether a training is efficacious.Practical implicationsIt is of increasing importance that organizations find ways to support employee well-being.

PurposePrior studies have shown various mediating and moderating mechanisms regarding the effect of employees' perceived overqualification on intention to leave (ITL). Nonetheless, only a few empirical studies have shed light on the negative underlying processes that explain this relationship. Furthermore, less is known about the role of high-performance work systems (HPWSs) in the overqualification literature. Drawing upon relative deprivation theory (RDT), this research attempts to fill these gaps by examining the mediating role of work-related boredom and the moderating role of perceived HPWSs in the association between perceived overqualification and ITL.Design/methodology/approachData from a sample of 188 employees working in a Greek manufacturing company were analyzed using the PROCESS macros for SPSS.FindingsThe results indicated that work-related boredom mediates the association between perceived overqualification and ITL. Moreover, HPWSs attenuated the relationship of perceived overqualification with both work-related boredom and ITL, such that their association was positive only when employees' perceptions of HPWSs were low.Originality/valueThis study adds to the existing literature regarding why and how perceived overqualification affects ITL. Even more, this is one of the first studies that examine the role of HPWSs in the literature of overqualification. Theoretical and practical implications were also considered.",art
10.1108/PR-09-2021-0632,"Employees' HR attributions count: the effects of high-performance work systems on employees' thriving at work and emotional exhaustion. PurposeAlthough prior research has documented substantive knowledge of the benefits of high-performance work systems (HPWS), results regarding both sides of HPWS are inconsistent. To reconcile these inconsistencies, the authors identified two specific HR attributions-employee well-being HR attribution and performance HR attribution, and examined their roles in the relationship between team-level HPWS and employees' thriving at work and emotional exhaustion.Design/methodology/approachThe authors collected multi-source data from 36 team leaders and 181 individuals. Given the nested nature of the data, the authors used Mplus 7.4 to conduct multilevel structural equation modeling for hypothesis testing.FindingsThe results showed that team-level HPWS and employee well-being HR attribution interact to affect psychological availability, which subsequently promotes thriving at work. However, team-level HPWS and employee performance HR attribution do not interact to influence role overload/psychological availability; team-level HPWS and employee well-being HR attribution do not interact to affect role overload.Originality/valueCurrent literature has overlooked identifying key contingencies for both sides of HPWS effects on employee outcomes. Therefore, this study developed a mediated moderation model and incorporated HR attributions to explore two distinct pathways by which HPWS affects employees' thriving at work and emotional exhaustion. The present study helps to reconcile the inconsistent findings regarding the HPWS double-edged sword nature. In addition, the authors focused on HPWS at the team level, which is also underexplored in the existing HPWS research.",art

PurposeStudies show that supervisor incivility can have detrimental consequences for subordinates. However, little is known about the job and personal resources that can reduce the effect of supervisor incivility on subordinates' counterproductive work behavior (CWB). Based on the Job Demand-Resources (JD-R) model, we investigate social job crafting (job resource) and internal locus of control (LOC; personal resource) as buffers on the relationship between supervisor incivility and subordinates' CWB toward the organization.Design/methodology/approach Two field studies to test our proposed hypotheses were conducted. A two-wave time-lagged design was used and data was collected from 115 supervisors and 318 subordinates from a large electricity provider company (study 1) and 121 employee-coworker dyads from a large insurance company (study 2).FindingsAcross the two studies it was found that supervisor incivility positively relates to subordinates' CWB toward the organization. Further, this relationship was weaker for individuals with high internal LOC and those who engaged in social job crafting.Practical implicationsThe findings are helpful for HR managers to figure out how to stop supervisor incivility through civility training and motivating employees to social job crafting behavior.Originality/valueThis study implies that social job crafting (job resource) and internal LOC (personal resource) are essential factors that can reduce the effects of supervisor incivility on subordinates' CWB toward the organization.",art

PurposePerceptions of employment histories are important insofar as they influence future job prospects. Critically, in light of the current pandemic, wherein many individuals are likely to have unanticipated employment gaps and/or temporary work experiences, this exploratory study aims to seek a better understanding of the signal associated with temporary employment histories, which is particularly germane to individuals' employment trajectories and a successful labour market recovery.Design/methodology/approachDrawing primarily on signalling theory and using a simulated hiring decision experiment, the authors examined the perceptions of temporary employment histories, as well as the period effect of COVID-19, a major exogenous event, on the attitudes of fictitious jobseekers with standard, temporary and unemployment histories.FindingsThe authors find that prior to COVID-19 unemployed and temporary-work candidates were perceived less favourably as compared to applicants employed in a permanent job. During the COVID-19 pandemic, assessments of jobseekers with temporary employment histories were less critical and the previously negative signal associated with job-hopping reversed. This study's third wave of data, which were collected post-COVID, showed that such perceptions largely dissipated, with the exception for those with a history of temporary work with different employers.Practical implicationsThe paper serves as a reminder to check, insofar as possible, preconceived biases of temporary employment histories to avoid potential attribution errors and miss otherwise capable candidates.Originality/valueThis paper makes a unique and timely contribution by focussing and examining the differential effect of economic climate, pivoted by the COVID-19 pandemic, on perceptions of temporary employment histories.",art

The authors argue that an intrinsic effect of telework like work extension mediates this relationship. Work extension is reflected in two employee behaviours: working in free time and presentism.Design/methodology/approach The proposed model has been estimated using the Preacher and Hayes bootstrap method for multiple mediation analysis, with 1,000 repetitions. The data used come from the sixth European Working Conditions Survey.Findings The analysis indicates that HBT does not pose an inherent risk for job stress but causes a change in the employees' behaviour, increasing working in free time and presenteeism and thus job stress. The mediation model indicates that once these behaviours are controlled, the effect of HBT is to reduce stress.Research limitations/implicationsThe authors argue that companies should focus on human resource practices to control workers' behaviours that have a detrimental effect on job stress while institutions should regulate HBT.Originality/value The analysis deepens the unclear relationship between HBT and job stress by introducing employees' behaviours concerning work extension into the equation.",art

Purpose This paper examines the factors that influence the work attitudes of employees and the conditional effects of family support on the job demand-turnover intention relationship. Design/methodology/approach The authors used a sample of 231 employees working in the manufacturing industry in Vietnam to test the conceptual model. Findings Drawing upon the job demands-resources (JD-R) model and job embeddedness theory, the authors found that employees' psychological capital and family support influenced turnover intentions through enhancing their job satisfaction. The authors also found that the influence of job demands on turnover intentions was altered when employees had higher levels of family support. Originality/value This study provides important insights for human resource managers regarding what may influence employees' job satisfaction and turnover intentions. The findings advance turnover literature by highlighting the important roles of both internal resources (psychological capital) and external resources (family support) in influencing employee turnover intentions in Vietnam.",art

Purpose Drawing upon theories of conservation of resources (COR), broaden-and-build (BnB), self-determination, and the job demands- resources (JD-R) model, this study uniquely tries to understand the mechanisms that contribute to happiness at work by proposing a model of the effects of emotional culture of joy on happiness at work, where psychological safety and relational attachments serve as intervening mechanisms among the aforesaid relationship. Design/methodology/approach A three-wave time-lagged study with 340 employees from Pakistani organizations was conducted. Data were analyzed using covariance-based structural equation modelling. Findings The results indicate that emotional culture of joy significantly predicts happiness at work. Furthermore, emotional culture of joy significantly and positively influences both psychological safety and relational attachment. Finally, the relationship between emotional culture of joy and happiness at work is found to be mediated by both relational attachment and psychological safety. Practical implications The results are of utmost importance as they provide insights to policy makers and organizations administrators on the value of emotional culture of joy and its contribution to employees' wellbeing, and indeed its role in fostering important psychological and emotional resources such as psychological safety and relational attachment. Originality/value This study is unique for the following reasons. First, it addresses and bridges a gap pertaining to the drivers of happiness at work. Second, this is the first study that considers emotional culture of joy as an antecedent to happiness at work. Third, the employment of both psychological safety and relational attachment as intervening mechanisms in the relationship between emotional culture of joy and happiness at work has not been previously addressed in the management and wellbeing literature. Finally, the study shifts direction from studying organizational drivers (i.e. HR, organization support, etc.) of happiness at work to the examination of psychological and emotional resources that may influence happiness at work.",art
10.1108/PR-03-2021-0179,"The impact of role overload on job crafting from the perspective of construal level theory. Purpose Previous studies have vague views about whether employees who are required to complete large amounts of work (i.e. role overload) would proactively create a change in their job characteristics (i.e. job crafting), because the cognitive mechanism underlying the nexus between role overload and job crafting is unclear. The aim of this study is to identify why and when role overload has an impact on job crafting. Design/methodology/approach This study builds a second-stage moderated mediation model. Using a two-wave panel field study of 213 employee-supervisor matched data, this study examines the proposed hypotheses. Findings Results show that role overload decreases construal level, which can determine the tendency of employees to focus on the feasibility (low level of construal) or desirability (high level of construal) of behaviors. Goal self-concordance is the degree to which employees pursue their personal goals based on feelings of personal interests and values. The authors find that goal self-concordance guides employees who have higher levels of construal to exert more effort in job crafting. The authors further find that goal self-concordance moderates the mediating role of construal level. Specifically, for employees in pursuit of self-concordant goals, role overload reduces their construal level, resulting in less effort in job crafting. For employees who do not pursue self-concordant goals, role overload decreases their construal level, thereby improving job crafting. Originality/value The findings of this study enrich the literature on role overload and job crafting by revealing the mechanism and boundary conditions of the relationship between role overload and job crafting.",art

Purpose This paper aims to investigate the idiosyncratic relationships between work and nonwork among dual-career professional couples (DCPCs) intentionally without children, considering individual members' role salience, nonwork responsibilities and care or career orientation. Design/methodology/approach Interview data from 21 Canadian and American couples (42 individuals) was used to explore the research question: How do DCPCs without children perceive their work-nonwork balance? Findings DCPCs without children are a heterogenous demographic. Some couples are career oriented, some care oriented, some exhibit both orientations, shaping their experience of work-nonwork balance. Unlike popular stereotypes, they do have nonwork responsibilities and interests outside of their thriving careers. Similar to their counterparts with children, they face conflicts managing work and nonwork domains. Originality/value Based on theories of role salience, work-nonwork conflict, enrichment and balance, the authors suggest that analyses of work-nonwork balance should include nonwork activities other than child caring. The authors further propose that the experience of the work-nonwork interface varies according to whether couples are careerist, conventional, non-conventional or egalitarian. The study also demonstrates that work-nonwork experiences are relational in nature and should be explored beyond a strictly individual perspective.",art

Purpose Although the impostor phenomenon is attributed to childhood experiences, theory on achievement motivation indicates that achievement-related fears can also be elicited by the context. Using achievement goal theory as a base, the authors investigate the effect of context-dependent predictors, job-fit, career stage and organisational tenure, on impostor fears. The authors also examined gender and the achievement-related traits, self-efficacy and locus of control, as predictors of impostor fears to advance knowledge on antecedents to impostor fears. Design/methodology/approach Two studies were conducted with 270 and 280 participants, each. In Study 1, a subset of 12 respondents participated in follow-up interviews. Findings Impostor fears tended to be predicted by organisational tenure and career stage in both studies and job-fit in Study 1. Self-efficacy and locus of control predicted impostor fears. Men and women reported similar levels of impostor fears. Practical implications The authors demonstrate the importance of context in eliciting impostor fears and partially support initial descriptions of antecedents to impostor fears. The findings contribute to the development of targeted managerial practices that can help with the development of interventions, such as orientation programmes, that will enhance socialisation processes and mitigate impostor fears. Originality/value The literature on imposter fears has not addressed their situational predictors, which the authors argue are important elements in the genesis and maintenance of impostor fears. The authors draw on achievement goal theory to explain the pattern of findings related to key situational characteristics and their influence on imposter fears. The findings for Sri Lanka, on personality predictors, are similar to those reported in studies focused on North America providing evidence of cross-cultural applicability of the concept.",art

Purpose This study aims to examine the influence of workplace spirituality on employee loyalty toward the organization, mediated through well-being at work. Furthermore, the study endeavors to test the difference in conceptual model estimates, across two groups of employees: those who work on contract/temporary and permanent basis. The study gains relevance particularly in the context of the emerging sharing economy, where jobs are primarily characterized by short-term contracts and freelancing. Design/methodology/approach This descriptive study was conducted among a sample of 523 educators working in private educational institutions in India. Self-reporting questionnaires were administered among the respondents, who were selected through the purposive sampling method. Structural equation modeling and multi-group analysis were done to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings The analysis revealed that workplace spirituality enriched employee well-being and loyalty toward the organization and evidence were found for indirect effects too. Variances were observed in the relationships, with respect to the different employment statuses of the personnel. Significant differences in the relationships were not found across temporary and permanent employment statuses. Interestingly, temporary employees experienced stronger influences between meaningful work, well-being and word-of-mouth. Results suggest the relevance of understanding employees' differential work experiences and attitudes and thus facilitate human resource strategies accordingly. Originality/value This study is pioneering in conceptualizing and testing a theoretical model linking workplace spirituality, well-being at work and employee loyalty, particularly in the context of employees who differ in their employment status, which is a critical aspect of modern-day organizations. Unlike traditional workplaces, in recent times, people come together and work along for shorter terms, as the case of a sharing economy and the thus emergent interpersonal dynamics between each other and with the workplace has significant repercussions on the organization. Theoretical and managerial implications with regard to the experience of workplace spirituality and job outcomes are elaborated, thus striving to fill a gap in the existing literature.",art

Purpose The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the importance and influence of paternity leave on individual level organizational outcomes. Drawing on signaling theory, the study examines the relationship between paid paternity leave entitlement (PPLE) and organizational attractiveness (OA) through a mediating path of anticipated organizational support (AOS). Furthermore, the study proposes that this mediated relationship would be conditional on traditional masculinity ideology (TMI) such that the relationship would be stronger for individuals who score low on TMI. Design/methodology/approach The study analyzed a moderated mediation model using the data from a survey experiment. Data were collected from 264 professionals enrolled in an executive education course and will soon be looking for employment. Findings The findings supported the mediating role of AOS between PPLE and OA. As predicted, the positive impact of PPLE on AOS and OA is stronger for individuals scoring low on TMI.

Purpose - While there has been growing interest in how personal and work-related factors shape employees' careers, we know little about how family demands affect career intentions. Drawing from role theory and boundary theory, we examine the indirect effect of family-role overload on career intentions via family-interferes-with-work (FIW), as well as the conditional indirect effect of boundary management on these relationships. Design/methodology/approach - Utilizing two waves of panel data that were collected in the third and fourth waves of the pandemic in Canada (n = 433), we conducted a structural equation model to test our hypotheses. Findings - Our analysis reveals that FIW mediates the relationship between family-role overload and (1) career change intention and (2) job turnover intention. The results also indicate that the effect of family-role overload on career intentions via FIW strengthens for employees with a low ability to enact preferred boundaries. Originality/value - This research shows the indirect effect of family-role overload on career intentions via FIW. This research also highlights how boundary management can buffer the effects of family-role overload on career intentions.",art

Purpose - Drawing upon social information processing theory, this study investigates the correlation between self-serving leadership and employee expediency. It also explores the mediating effect of self-interest motivation and the moderating effect of trait mindfulness. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 147 part-time MBA students were enlisted to participate in a scenario experiment (Study 1), and 291 valid employee questionnaires were collected through a multiple-time point survey (Study 2). SPSS 23.0, MPLUS 8.0 and PROCESS programs were used to analyze the data and test the hypotheses. Findings - Study 1 illustrated a positive correlation between self-serving leadership and employee expediency. It also identified self-interest motivation as a mediating factor in the correlation between self-serving leadership and expediency. Study 2 replicated the results obtained in Study 1 and expanded upon them by demonstrating that trait mindfulness moderates the association between self-serving leadership and self-interest motivation. Additionally, trait mindfulness moderates the indirect effect of self-serving leadership on expediency. Practical implications - This research argues that organizations should take steps to prevent self-serving leadership in order to reduce employee expediency. Furthermore, it is advisable to provide ethics training to employees who exhibit high trait mindfulness, as they show increased sensitivity to self-serving leadership and are more likely to engage in unethical behavior. Originality/value - This study expands the existing research on the ethical outcomes of self-serving leadership and contributes to a deeper understanding of the negative aspects of trait mindfulness.",art

The authors examine the role of collaborative human resource management (HRM) and relational leadership (RL) in this process.Design/methodology/approachThe study took a two-stage qualitative methodological approach to examine relational leadership as it emerges in a newly formed cross-functional team at a large German fashion house. In stage one, 10 interviews were conducted with members of the new project team over three months and in stage two six external knowledge exchange partners were interviewed.FindingsCollaborative HRM promotes greater social exchange, trust and commitment of team members internal and external to the organization to support the emergence of RL, which is critical for OI. The authors found that collaborative HRM practices such as team-based recruitment, team-based training, team-based performance management with rewards systems and job design support the emergence of RL. Moreover, RL practices such as congruence and commitment towards team goals subsequently promoted the development of knowledge sourcing and sharing (KSS) to support OI.Originality/valueThe study is the first to demonstrate how collaborative HRM enables RL practices to help newly formed teams overcome challenges with achieving KSS to successfully engage with internal and external partners for OI.

PurposeThis study aims to understand how and when employees' pandemic fears influence their lateness attitude, with a particular focus on how this influence is mediated by emotional exhaustion and moderated by a perceived safety climate.Design/methodology/approachSurvey data were collected among employees in the retail sector.FindingsA core mechanism that explains the escalation of pandemic fears into beliefs that tardiness is acceptable is employees' sense that employees are emotionally overextended by work. The extent to which employees perceive that their organization prioritizes safety issues subdues this detrimental process though.Practical implicationsFor human resource management (HRM) practice, the findings point to the notable danger that employees who cannot stop ruminating about an external crisis, and feel emotionally overburdened as a result, might compromise their own organizational standing by devoting less effort to punctuality. To disrupt this dynamic, HR managers can create organizational climates that emphasize safety practices.Originality/valueThis study adds to HRM research by revealing a pertinent source of personal adversity, pandemic fears, and how the fears affects tendencies to embrace tardiness at work. The study explicates how emotional exhaustion functions as a core conduit that connects this resource-draining condition with propensities to show up late, as well as how safety climate perceptions can buffer this translation.",art

PurposeDrawing upon the conservation of resources (COR) theory, this paper investigates the moderated mediation model linking benevolent leadership to organizational citizenship behaviors towards the organization (OCBO) and towards individuals (OCBI) in the context of higher education. The mediating roles of leader-member exchange and affective commitment as well as the moderating roles of the two attachment styles-attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance-are also examined.Design/methodology/approachData were collected from a sample of 333 university lecturers and analyzed using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM).FindingsThe results demonstrate that leader-member exchange and affective commitment are mediating resources that help benevolent leaders motivate university lecturers to engage in two types of OCBs. Moreover, attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance act as the respective enhancer and inhibitor for the indirect effects of benevolent leadership on both OCBs through leader-member exchange. In contrast, the relationships between benevolent leadership and two types of OCBs through the mediating role of affective commitment are not contingent on the attachment styles of lecturers.Practical implicationsThe findings suggest that university leaders who aim at promoting OCBs among lecturers should deploy benevolent leadership style to facilitate a positive social exchange relationship as well as foster their affective commitment. Such leadership style is especially effective in influencing lecturers who possess attachment anxiety personality traits.Originality/valueThis pioneer research develops and empirically tests a COR theory-grounded moderated mediation model pertaining to benevolent leadership and lecturers' OCBs. The findings contribute to the educational management literature by demonstrating that benevolent leadership, a crucial organizational resource, significantly motivates lecturers' voluntary and extra-role behaviors in a dynamic and contingent manner. Leader-member exchange and affective commitment are important mediating resources in the process of transforming benevolent leadership into beneficial behaviors. Further, the effectiveness of benevolent leadership largely depends on lecturers' personality traits of attachment anxiety and avoidance. These novel mediating and moderating findings demonstrate the sequential and interaction effects of various organizational and individual resources on lecturers' OCBs; thus, adding value to the COR theory's core principles, including resource caravans and resource investment behaviors.",art

Purpose In response to a growing interest in worker well-being in a work-life which is experiencing fundamental transformations, this paper builds and tests a research model on the role of psychological capital (PsyCap) in three different forms of engagement at work. Engagement at work has been identified as one of the most significant drivers of successful work performance. Design/methodology/approach Using a quantitative research design, data were collected from 396 highly specialized knowledge workers through anonymous questionnaires. Research hypotheses were tested with linear models. Findings Analysis results indicate that all three forms of engagement are affected by PsyCap which consists of self-efficacy, resilience, hope and optimism, but the effect of individual dimensions is not the same for different forms of engagement at work. Practical implications It is argued that paying more attention to personal resources, such as the dimensions of PsyCap, and acknowledging diversity among individual workers offer possibilities for increasing employee performance. HR personnel can benefit organizational performance by boosting different dimensions of employees' PsyCap for different engagement purposes.

Purpose - This study aims to examine the impact of managers' inclusive leadership (IL) on knowledge-sharing (KS) behavior. Additionally, the authors consider the cross-level moderation effect of diversity in the biological sex of employees on the relationship between IL and employee KS behaviors.Design/methodology/approach - A two-wave questionnaire survey was conducted in a large Japanese company. The sample included 827 employees (254 men and 573 women) in 129 groups. The authors, then, conducted a cross-level analysis using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM).Findings - IL promotes two types of KS among employees: knowledge donating (KD) and knowledge collecting (KC). Additionally, the moderating effects of employee biological-sex diversity on the relationship between IL and KS varied according to the KS type. IL had a positive effect on KD only in groups with higher biological-sex diversity, and did not affect groups with lower biological-sex diversity. Biological-sex diversity did not moderate the relationship between IL and KC.Practical implications - This study has practical implications, especially for personnel departments with high diversity in employees' biological sex.

The article endeavors to provide a retrospective of the journal to commemorate the journal's 50th anniversary. Design/methodology/approach The article employs a variety of bibliometric analysis techniques such as performance analysis, co-authorship analysis, bibliographic coupling, and negative binomial regression to provide a retrospective of PR. Findings The performance analysis suggests that PR has grown steadily in PR's publications and citations. Though most of PR's contributions originate from Europe, a geographical shift toward global contributions has been witnessed in recent years. Besides that, a culture of collaboration among PR authors has manifested and proliferated over time. Though a third of European studies are qualitative and more than 90% of Asian studies are quantitative, PR studies, as a whole, are moving away from conceptual and qualitative to empirical and quantitative research. Next, the bibliographic coupling of the PR corpus indicates five major themes-namely, human resource management policies and practices; personnel competency, experience, and well-being; career management and employee engagement; strategic human resource management; and organizational culture and workplace environment. Finally, the negative binomial regression reveals that article age, abstract and article length and number of keywords and references significantly drive PR citations.

Purpose Drawing on the dual process model of ideology and prejudice, the purpose of this paper is to examine whether, how and when a supervisor's Machiavellianism leads to subordinates' perceptions of abusive supervision. In doing so, the authors also explore the mediating role of the supervisor's competitive world views and the moderating role of subordinates' performance on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach The theoretical model was tested using three sources of data from supervisors, their subordinates and the organization. Hierarchical linear model analysis was run on supervisor and subordinate dyadic data for testing whether subordinates' performance moderated the mediated relationships or not. Findings The results suggest that the supervisors' competitive worldviews explain the positive link between their Machiavellianism and subordinates' perceptions of abusive supervision. The results highlight that the mediation effect of supervisors' competitive worldviews on the link between their Machiavellianism and their subordinates' perceptions of abusive supervision is more pronounced when subordinates' performance is low than when it is high. Research limitations/implications This research contributes to the authors' knowledge of the link between supervisors' Machiavellianism and abusive supervision, and how the toxic influence of their Machiavellianism is mediated by supervisors' competitive worldviews.

Purpose This study aims to examine the moderating effects of psychological entitlement and perceived organizational support (POS) on the relationship between work connectivity behavior after-hours (WCBA) and job satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 217 full-time employees of an Internet company in China at two points in time separated by about one month. Hierarchical regression and simple slope analyses were conducted to test hypotheses. Findings The results showed that WCBA was negatively related to job satisfaction and that this relationship could be mitigated by POS. Moreover, psychological entitlement aggravated this relationship, and this aggravating effect was stronger when POS was at low levels. Practical implications Managers should avoid intervening employees' nonwork domains too much. If this is unavoidable, managers should provide adequate organizational support to help employees cope with the challenges brought by WCBA. Besides, managers need to pay close attention to highly entitled employees and take measures to modify their expectations. Originality/value First, this study enriches the understanding of what WCBA is and how WCBA works by investigating the influencing mechanism of WCBA from the perspectives of effort-reward imbalance and job demands-resources. Second, by verifying the moderating effects of psychological entitlement and POS, this study provides insights into the boundaries of the WCBA-job satisfaction relationship. Third, this study contributes to the literature on psychological entitlement by identifying its one applicable condition.",art

Purpose Based on the service-profit chain perspective, this study investigates whether service-oriented human resource practices can enhance customer outcomes through motivational mechanisms (i.e. intrinsic/extrinsic satisfaction) as well as emotional mechanisms (i.e. emotional labor strategies). Design/methodology/approach This study collected paired data from 220 service workers and their customers at different time points from 80 service firms. Multilevel path-analysis was conducted to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings Our results indicate that firm-level extensive training is positively related to service workers' intrinsic job satisfaction, which in turn increases deep acting. In addition, firm-level incentive compensation is positively associated with service workers' extrinsic job satisfaction, which in turn reduces surface acting. Finally, service employee's deep acting enhances customer loyalty and willingness to recommend via customer satisfaction. Practical implications The service organization should (1) stress the importance of incentive compensation to decrease surface acting via enhancing extrinsic job satisfaction and (2) provide extensive service training to improve service employees' intrinsic satisfaction and deep acting, leading to favorable customer outcomes. Originality/value The present study identifies the critical roles of motivational and emotional mechanisms in transferring service-oriented human resource practices to customer outcomes and employing rigorous research design to enhance the internal/external validity of our findings.",art
10.1108/PR-05-2020-0330,"How work-life conflict affects employee outcomes of Chinese only-children academics: the moderating roles of gender and family structure. Purpose China's controversial one-child policy has been blamed for creating an ageing population, a generation of employees without siblings and a 4-2-1 family structure that places eldercare responsibility, primarily on women. Current understanding of how this affects contemporary employees' work-life interface is lacking. This study examined the moderating roles of family structure and gender in the relationships between work-life conflict (WLC), job satisfaction and career aspiration for university academics. Design/methodology/approach Online and self-administered surveys were used to collect data, which involved 420 academic staff in three Chinese research universities. Findings Our results revealed that WLC is positively related to career aspiration, and this relationship is stronger for academics with siblings and, within the only-children group, significantly stronger for women than for men. WLC is also negatively related to job satisfaction, and this relationship is stronger for only-children academics. Research limitations/implications Results were limited by a cross-sectional sample of modest size. Nevertheless, this study contributes to the understanding of gender roles and changing family structure in the work-life interface of Chinese academics. Practical implications Our findings have implications for both universities seeking to improve staff well-being and for wider society. A number of support mechanisms are proposed to enhance the ability of only children, especially women, to operate as effective members of the labour market. Originality/value Our results showed that only-children academics face a unique set of difficulties across career and family domains, which have been previously neglected in literature.",art

Purpose This article explores the various stakeholders' perceptions of the ways digital work is organised within the sharing economy and the social implications of the transformation of work. Design/methodology/approach Applying social media analytics (SMA) concerning the sharing economy platform Foodora, a total of 3,251 user-generated content was collected and organised throughout the social media landscape in Sweden over 12 months, and 18 stakeholder groups were identified, discussing digital work within seven thematic categories. Findings The results show that the stakeholder groups in the Swedish context primarily expressed negative views of Foodora's way of organising digital work. The social media posts outlined the distributive and procedural justice related to the working conditions, boycott and protests and critical incidents, as well as the collective bargaining of Foodora. Originality/value By utilising a novel SMA method, this study contributes to the extant literature on the sharing economy by providing a systematic assessment concerning the impact of the sharing economy platform on the transformation of work and the associated social consequences.",art

PurposeThis study aims to understand how organizations use social media for recruitment by identifying (1) what type of information is promoted and (2) what type of engagement and interaction occurs in hiring-related Instagram posts. Moreover, drawing on the social media affordance approach, this study further examines whether certain information and interactions in Instagram posts lead to better outcomes.Design/methodology/approachUsing a hashtag-based sampling strategy, we conducted a content analysis of 274 hiring-related Instagram posts by organizations to identify different types of information and interaction and then conducted a series of t-tests to examine the impact of the observed information and interactions on outcomes.FindingsWe found four types of hiring-related information and identified ten types of interactions driven by both organizations and audiences. Additionally, we found that hiring-related Instagram posts with a high degree of visibility and association led to more likes and comments.Practical implicationsThis study's results can benefit organizations that use Instagram to attract jobseekers and potential applicants, as different types of information and interaction lead to different outcomes.Originality/valueSince this is the first study to content analyze Instagram posts associated with hiring, it will provide important implications for both practice and research.",art

PurposeThis study investigates how compulsory citizenship behaviors (CCB) affect employees' energy and motivation to engage in other voluntary behaviors, such as service-oriented citizenship behavior and creativity. Specifically, we explore how employees' perceptions of job overload mediate this relationship, based on their generational differences.Design/methodology/approachThis study employed a time-lagged survey design to collect data from 265 frontline employees and their supervisors in Pakistani-based organizations. The data was collected in three rounds, with a three-week gap between each round.FindingsThe findings suggest that role overload, resulting from compulsory citizenship pressure, undermines millennial employees' service-oriented organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and creativity. However, these negative effects are less salient among non-millennials.Practical implicationsThe findings of this study provide valuable insights for managers, emphasizing the importance of exercising caution when imposing excessive citizenship pressures on employees against their will. In addition, organizations and human resource (HR) managers should consider devising policies for formal recognition of voluntary behaviors that contribute to organizational effectiveness.Originality/valueThis study contributes to existing CCB research by unraveling the previously unexplored mediating role of role overload and the contingency role of generational difference in explaining how and when coerced citizenship demands hinder employees' propensity to engage in service-oriented OCB and creativity.",art
10.1108/PR-04-2022-0313,"The curvilinear relationships between perceived development human resource practices and both affective commitment and work stress: the moderating effects of age. PurposeThis paper aims to reveal the curvilinear relationships between perceived development human resource practices (DHRPs) and both affective commitment and work stress, and the moderating effects of age on the curvilinear relationships.Design/methodology/approachHypotheses were developed from an employee-oriented contingent view based on the person-job fit theory and lifespan development theories. Methods suggested by Haans et al. (2016) and Dawson (2014) to test curvilinear relationships and related moderations, and a two-wave survey data from 742 Chinese employees were used.FindingsThe results showed that perceived DHRPs related to affective commitment in an inverted U shape and work stress in a U shape. However, age moderated the nature of the relationships such that both the curvilinear relationships only existed under low age while under high age perceived DHRPs related to affective commitment positively and work stress negatively.Originality/valueThis study advances the prevailing linear (positive or negative) thinking on the DHRPs-outcomes relationships by showing that perceived DHRPs relate to both affective commitment and work stress nonlinearly. Moreover, different from existing findings that age moderates the strength of the linear DHRPs-outcomes relationships, the results indicate that age moderates the nature of the relationships between perceived DHRPs and affective commitment and work stress. This implies a refined age-differential approach to use DHRPs to sustain a committed and healthy workforce in the context of workforce aging.",art

PurposeBased on the JD-R model and process-focused HRM perspective, this research paper aims to investigate the processes underlying the relationship between AI-enabled HR analytics and employee well-being outcomes (resilience) that received less attention in the AI-driven HRM literature. Specifically, this study aims to examine the indirect effect between AI-enabled HR analytics and employee resilience via job crafting, moderated by HRM system strength to highlight the contextual stimulus of AI-enabled HR analytics.Design/methodology/approachThe authors adopted a time-lagged research design (one-month interval) to test the proposed hypotheses. The authors used two-wave surveys to collect data from 175 full-time hotel employees in China.FindingsThe findings indicated that employees' perceptions of AI-enabled HR analytics enhance their resilience. This study also found the mediation role of job crafting in the mentioned relationship. Moreover, the positive effects of AI-enabled HR analytics on employee resilience amplify in the presence of a strong HRM system.Practical implicationsOrganizations that aim to utilize AI-enabled HR analytics to achieve organizational missions should also dedicate attention to its associated employee well-being outcomes.Originality/valueThis study enriched the literature with regard to AI-driven HRM in that it identifies the mediating role of job crafting and the moderating role of HRM system strength in the relationship between AI-enabled HR analytics and employee resilience.",art

PurposeHybrid and virtual work settings offer greater flexibility and autonomy, yet they also have the paradoxical effect of weakening the connection of employees to each other and their identification with the organization. The purpose of this article is to discuss how to manage this paradox effectively. Design/methodology/approachLeveraging structural adaptation theory, the authors discuss hybrid and virtual work as one of five dimensions of team interdependence that collectively determine the tightness of coupling between team members.FindingsThe authors propose that the introduction of virtual and hybrid work can lead to a lower sense of belonging and identification with the organization that would need to be counteracted by respective increases in team interdependence in one or several of the remaining dimensions of team interdependence.Originality/valueThe authors apply research on team interdependence to develop a series of practical interventions that can address the Great Resignation. These interventions seek to enhance employees' experiences of belongingness after the shift to virtual and hybrid work. In doing so, the authors provide a toolkit that organizations can leverage to improve their employees' experiences in a post-COVID-19 workplace.",art

PurposeThis study intends to advance the research on the relationship between high-performance work systems (HPWS) and change readiness by examining the mediating role of positive employee outcomes. Therefore, the streams of strategic human resource management (SHRM) and change management are studied in the context of digital transformation in the post-COVID-19 pandemic scenario.Design/methodology/approachPrimary responses from 409 Information Technology (IT) employees were analysed to investigate the mediating relationship between HPWS, positive employee outcomes and employee readiness to change. Researchers used statistical techniques to analyse the data, such as confirmatory factor analysis, correlations, regression and bootstrapping. In addition, sequential mediation was examined using PROCESS Macro and syntax for SPSS.FindingsResults of the study revealed that implementation of HPWS through extensive training and development, performance-based appraisal and compensation, participation in decision-making, flexible work arrangements and rigorous recruitment and staffing results in enhanced employee-level outcomes. Thereby conclusively impacting their readiness to change for digital transformations.Practical implicationsThis study revisits the elements of HPWS in the post-pandemic work-from-anywhere (WFA) scenario. Thus, it provides adequate indications that investment in designing bundles of change-oriented human resource (HR) practices amplifies the chances of success of a change initiative by creating a favourable mindset and attitude among IT employees in India.Originality/valueThis study is among the earliest to link two major streams of SHRM and change management by establishing HPWS as an essential antecedent of a change-related outcome by introducing multiple mediators in the sequence.

Purpose Work-from-home (WFH) arrangement is implemented to enable employees to achieve work-life balance. However, WFH arrangement can be less than ideal. This study developed a WFH framework using qualitative data. Design/methodology/approach An open-ended survey was conducted and participated by 621 employees. The data were examined using the qualitative content analysis method. Findings Work performance and personal well-being have been identified as WFH outcomes, and 12 relevant research propositions have been developed. Constraints to WFH effectiveness include household and organisational factors whilst instrumental and emotional support were identified as the facilitating conditions. Two moderators were also identified: temporal flexibility and commitment orientation. Research limitations/implications This study provides a framework that support effective implementation of WFH and similar flexible work arrangements. Managing time, situation, emotions and attitudes are coping strategies used by WFH employees, and the efficacy of these strategies needs further empirical investigation. Practical implications Three main factors have been identified as significant in determining WFH effectiveness. Understanding these elements can help managers design solutions to help employees manage work-home boundaries, improving their work performance and well-being. Originality/value The Constraints-Coping-Effectiveness WFH framework and research propositions help organisations build WFH guidelines and policies. This study also recognises commitment orientation, which links resources, strategies and outcomes.

Purpose This study aims to examine configurations of person-centered psychological change during organizational restructuring and downsizing in a public sector setting. Drawing on a social cognitive framework of organizational change the authors explore and identify the existence of different groups of employees who demonstrate varied responses (on commitment, engagement and anxiety) to restructuring and downsizing. Design/methodology/approach Surveys were collected from employees in three longitudinal waves (Time 1 N = 253; Time 2 N = 107; Time 3 N = 93, twelve months apart) at a UK public sector organization shortly before, during and after restructuring and downsizing. Findings Three classes of response emerged based on levels of and change in anxiety, organizational commitment and work engagement: a positive Flourishers profile was identified along with two relatively negative response profiles, labeled as Recoverers and Ambivalents. Higher levels of job control accounted for membership of the more positive response profile; higher structural uncertainty predicted membership of the most negative response group. Practical implications Using a person-centered approach, the authors form an understanding of different types of employee responses to downsizing; along with potential factors that help explain why groups of employees may exhibit certain psychological response patterns and may need to be managed differently during change. Thus, this approach provides greater understanding to researchers and managers of the varied impact that restructuring/downsizing has on the workforce. Originality/value To date there has been little research exploring employee responses to organizational restructuring and downsizing that has attempted to take a person-centered approach, which assumes population heterogeneity. Unlike variable centered approaches, this unique approach helps identify different patterns of employee responses to restructuring and downsizing.",art

Purpose This paper aims to explore the mechanism underlying the relationship between abusive supervision differentiation (ASD) and team performance. The moderating roles of inter-team and intra-team competitive climate are also examined. Design/methodology/approach This research collects data from 419 employees and 71 supervisors from hospitals and financial companies in China. Techniques include descriptive statistics and hierarchical multiple regression are applied to analyze the data. Findings This research finds that (1) team relationship conflict mediated the relationship between ASD and team performance and (2) intra-team competitive climate strengthened the indirect relationship between ASD and team performance through team relationship conflict. Practical implications The results indicate that organizations should take measures to minimize the occurrence of abusive supervision. Team leaders should increase self-control and avoid abusing employees. Furthermore, organizations should establish an open and fair reward and punishment system to avoid cutthroat competition. Originality/value This study advances our knowledge of how ASD results in poor team effectiveness. This contributes to the literature by identifying team relationship conflict as a mediating mechanism linking the negative association of ASD with team performance. Additionally, competitive climate enriches the individual-focused team-level model of abusive supervision.",art

Purpose This paper compares how women leaders in four US industries-higher education, faith-based non-profits, healthcare and law-experience 15 aspects of gender bias. Design/methodology/approach This study used convergent mixed methods to collect data from 1,606 participants. It included quantitative assessment of a validated gender bias scale and qualitative content analysis of open-ended responses. Findings Results suggest that, while gender bias is prevalent in all four industries, differences exist. Participants in higher education experienced fewer aspects of gender bias than the other three industries related to male culture, exclusion, self-limited aspirations, lack of sponsorship and lack of acknowledgement. The faith-based sample reported the highest level of two-person career structure but the lowest levels of queen bee syndrome, workplace harassment and salary inequality. Healthcare tended towards the middle, reporting higher scores than one industry and lower than another while participants working in law experienced more gender bias than the other three industries pertaining to exclusion and workplace harassment. Healthcare and law were the two industries with the most similar experiences of bias.

Purpose This paper examines how human resources (HR) professionals in the UK have supported employee wellbeing during the coronavirus disease (COVID) pandemic. It considers the extent to which HR professionals were prepared for the crisis and their readiness in supporting the wellbeing of their people. Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 senior HR professionals working across the public and private sectors in the UK. Using an in-depth interview structure, the research explored how respondents both reacted to and managed the crisis in their respective organisations. Template analysis was used to analyse the data allowing a certain degree of fluidity in the establishment of ordered relationships between the themes. Findings This study finds that business continuity plans turned out to be useless during the pandemic because they focussed on data, not people. It highlights the tension between home-working and burn-out as online presenteeism increased due to staff changing their behaviour in response to self-surveillance. The paper emphasises the importance of soft skills and authentic leadership and the tensions in respect of equity. Research limitations/implications The study was conducted with HR professionals in the UK, not internationally. Although the sample did include HR professionals from across the public, private and third sectors, the experience may not be representative of all those working in HR. Originality/value This research found that those organisations that had engaged in business continuity planning prior to the pandemic focussed on the retrieval and accessibility of data rather than people. This prioritises staff as a resource rather than emphasising people as an organisation's most valuable asset. Furthermore, the study found that staff worked harder and for longer periods of time as a consequence of self-imposed surveillance. Organisational responses were contradictory as despite implementing well-being strategies to promote physical and mental health, there was little evidence of an effective response to this online presenteeism.",art

Purpose With little empirical attention devoted to the consequences of loneliness in the workplace, the present study investigated the effect of workplace loneliness on creative performance, organizational citizenship behaviors and work-family family conflict. Furthermore, psychological capital was examined as a moderator of these relationships. Design/methodology/approach The proposed model was tested in two different studies on a sample of employees from manufacturing (Sample 1: n = 379) and service (Sample 2: n = 559) organizations in India. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires at two different points in time. Confirmatory factor analysis and multiple hierarchical regressions were used to test the hypothesized model. Findings While workplace loneliness was found to negatively affect creative performance and organizational citizenship behavior, its impact on work-family conflict was positive. Results revealed a significant moderating effect of psychological capital on these relationships. Psychological capital buffered the impact of loneliness in a way that the detrimental effect of loneliness on performance behaviors was less severe for the individuals with high psychological capital. Originality/value The study makes an original and noteworthy contribution to the loneliness and negative emotions literature by advancing the understanding around the consequences and boundary conditions of loneliness in the workplace. It carries important implications for managing loneliness in the organizations by identifying psychological capital as an important personal resource for mitigating the effects of workplace loneliness on creativity and extra-role behaviors.",art

Purpose Drawing on self-determination theory (SDT), this study aims to understand the adverse effects of customer mistreatment on employee performance and well-being by thwarting the satisfaction of employees' basic psychological needs. It also examines how these negative effects may be mitigated by empowerment human resource management (HRM) practices. Design/methodology/approach Two studies were conducted using survey data collected in China. In Study 1, cross-sectional data from 321 telemarketing employees were analyzed to examine how customer mistreatment reduces the satisfaction of employees' basic psychological needs, harming job performance and job satisfaction. In Study 2, multiwave, multisource data were collected from 149 property agents and their supervisors to replicate the findings of Study 1 and further test empowerment HRM as a moderator of the relationship between customer mistreatment and satisfaction of needs. Findings The results from both studies show that customer mistreatment leads to low job performance and job satisfaction via reduced satisfaction of employees' needs for autonomy and competence but not relatedness. Moreover, the negative effect on the satisfaction of employees' needs for autonomy and competence was buffered when organizations had high empowerment HRM practices in place. Originality/value This study provides new insights on customer mistreatment by understanding its effects from a motivational perspective, which has not been considered in prior research. It also explores how HRM practices can help satisfy employee needs in adverse work environments induced by customer mistreatment.",art
10.1002/hrm.22213,"Do women perceive incivility from men as selective? Examining main effects, coping responses, and boundary conditions. Women are more likely than men to be targets of incivility in the workplace. Scholars have referred to this pattern as selective incivility and suggest that incivility directed toward women-that is, selective incivility-is a form of modern sexism in the workplace. However, it remains unclear whether women themselves make sense of incivility from men as a form of gender bias, and when such perceptions shape whether women engage in unique responses to incivility perceived as selective. Drawing on social identity theory, we develop a conceptual model to better understand these relationships. Across two studies with working women, we show that women perceive male-instigated incivility as selective. Further, our findings show that women are more likely to engage in problem-focused-responses (i.e., direct confrontation and formal reporting), rather than emotion-focused responses (i.e., avoidance) in response to incivility perceived as selective and that these coping responses are, at times, moderated by the frequency of incivility. Overall, our research advances the literature on incivility, selective incivility, and gender bias at work, offers practical implications for managers seeking to foster workplace inclusion, and suggests novel directions for future research.",art

Despite extensive developments in the field of Human Resource Management, we still have limited and fragmented knowledge of how the external and internal environment of an organization influences direct employee voice. In this conceptual paper, we draw on signaling theory and theorize on whether and, if so, how direct employee voice and organizational voice climate are shaped at times of macro and organizational turbulence. Specifically, we introduce the concepts of solidary, utilitarian, and opportunistic crisis-related Human Resource (HR) practices and propose that they send different signals to employees, influencing their voice perceptions in distinctive ways. We also theorize that employees interpret these signals vis-a-vis the experienced meso- and macroturbulence, a process that affects HR system strength and the subsequent formulation of voice perceptions and voice climate emergence. With this work, we contribute to the voice and strategic HR literature by offering an integrated and multilayered understanding of how top-down processes at turbulent times such as crisis-related HR practices can influence bottom-up emergent phenomena.",art

This paper reflects on the paradigmatic assumptions and ideologies that have shaped algorithmic management research. We identify two sets of assumptions: one about the ontology of algorithms (which holds that human resource management [HRM] algorithms are non-human entities with material agency) and one about the ontology of management that HRM algorithms afford (which understands algorithmic management as a form of control for maximizing economic/shareholder value). We explain how these core assumptions underpin existing research of HRM algorithms, causing blind spots that hinder new ways of understanding and studying algorithmic management. After identifying and unpacking the assumptions and blind spots, we offer avenues to overcome these blind spots, allowing for future research based on new ideological assumption grounds that will help move algorithmic management scholarship further in significant ways.",art
10.1002/hrm.22187,"Beyond employer brand content: The role of employer brand process attributes in understanding employees' reactions toward their employer. Employees play a central role in organizational functioning and representation. HR managers thus strive to create an attractive employer image that stimulates employees' attachment and ambassadorship. However, presently, there is limited research about how employees perceive and react toward their organization's employer brand. More importantly, the studies available have focused on content attributes only (i.e., instrumental and symbolic image dimensions). This has resulted in limited (content-based) understanding of the construct and failure to incorporate its branding-related aspects (process attributes) which represent the crux of employer branding theory. Thus, using the HRM system strength theory and employer branding literature, this article examines three process characteristics (i.e., employer brand distinctiveness, consistency, and consensus) vis-a-vis instrumental and symbolic content attributes to understand employee reactions (i.e., employer attractiveness, organizational identification, and employee ambassadorship). Data were collected at two times through Prolific Academic with 254 UK and US employees. Results suggest that employer brand process attributes are valuable sources to enhance employees' identification with their organization. Moreover, distinctiveness and consistency seem especially instrumental in enhancing employees' attractiveness perceptions and display of positive ambassadorship. In addition, the process attributes explain significant incremental and unique variance beyond content attributes in employee reactions.",art

Extant literature has generated limited understanding of whether and how sustainable human resource management (HRM) will lead to better and more sustainable outcomes, such as enhanced employee well-being and improved employee performance. Moving toward common good values and drawing on the job demands-resources model, this study theorizes and tests the relationships among sustainable HRM practices, employee resilience, work engagement, and employee performance. The empirical results of a multilevel and multisource study in the Chinese context provide supporting evidence for our theoretical model. The findings demonstrate that sustainable HRM practices positively affect employee resilience, and lead to a high level of work engagement among employees. Employee resilience also has an indirect effect on employee performance through work engagement. This study, with its theoretical and practical implications, reveals a serial mediation mechanism through which sustainable HRM practices contribute to both employee well-being and employee performance.",art
10.1002/hrm.22138,"Arousing employee pro-environmental behavior: A synergy effect of environmentally specific transformational leadership and green human resource management. Employee proactive pro-environmental behavior (PEB) has been increasingly emphasized as an essential behavior benefiting the environment and organizational sustainability. Nevertheless, both scholars and practitioners need a fuller yet nuanced understanding of the antecedents and boundary condition of PEB. Drawing from theories of cue consistency and proactivity, we advance an interaction perspective to explain how environmentally specific transformational leadership (ESTL) as guidance and green human resource management (GHRM) as normative practices interact to arouse employee PEB and how three fine-grained proactive psychological states of green self-efficacy, environmental self-accountability, and environmental passion transmit these effects. Two lab experiments constructively offered causal support for our main hypotheses, and a multilevel, multiphase, and multisource field study verified our integrative model and enhanced the generalizability of conclusions. Results indicated that in addition to the direct positive effects, organization-level GHRM, and individual-level ESTL also showed a synergy effect in predicting employee PEB. Three differentiated proactive psychological states positively linked the underlying processes, especially in the high-GHRM context. The findings highlight a multilevel antecedent framework of employee PEB and provide a useful attempt to answer the lingering debate about interactions between leadership and human resource management systems.",art
10.1002/hrm.22258,"The Double Empathy Problem and Person-Environment Fit: Mutual Understanding and Bidirectional Adjustment in Autistic Talent Acquisition. Organizations are starting to actively invest in hiring initiatives aimed at recruiting autistic talent. However, given many of these initiatives are in their infancy, knowledge of autism and how best to assess and support autistic employees is low. Building on person-environment fit (P-E fit) theory and the double empathy problem, we examine how neurodiversity employment programs build mutual understanding and construct fit between autistic employees and their hiring organizations. We further explore the role of third-party neurodivergent talent consultants (NTCs) in aiding these efforts during the birth stage of the cycle of talent. In Study 1, we use action research involving in-depth structured interviews of participants (managers, coaches, and autistic employees) in a neurodiversity employment program at a major corporation in the financial services industry, supplemented with additional interviews of hiring managers and coaches with similar roles in other organizational settings. In Study 2, we collect qualitative survey data from autistic adults participating in other neurodiversity employment programs. Using these data, we explicate the practices that remove barriers to autistic employment and processes of ongoing coaching and support from NTCs that build and manage the double empathy problem by enhancing mutual understanding and increasing the perceptions of fit. We find that NTCs facilitate the acquisition of autistic talent through revised job search and recruitment (e.g., tailored job descriptions), alternative screening procedures (e.g., hands-on assessments), and supported socialization and onboarding (e.g., communication, networking).",art

Workplace nepotism, the preferential treatment based on kinship or familial ties, is a pervasive phenomenon that permeates every corner of our global workforce, transcending cultures, countries, industries, and organizations. Despite its ubiquitous presence, research on nepotism remains fragmented and scattered, with diverse disciplines seldom converging or cross-referencing one another. In this integrative review, we synthesize, integrate, and critically assess the extant body of knowledge about workplace nepotism. Our aim is to provide HR scholars with a panoramic view of the known, the unknown, and the uncharted territories to move the field forward. To this end, we first provide a clear conceptualization of nepotism, setting it apart from closely related constructs. Second, we offer a comprehensive review of empirical evidence that summarizes the antecedents, consequences, and theoretical foundations of nepotism. Importantly, our review adopts an actor-centric perspective, advocating that three main sets of actors are meaningfully involved in nepotism (i.e., instigators, beneficiaries, and third parties), thereby contributing to theory by showing that nepotism may differentially relate to outcomes depending on which actor's perspective is taken. Third, we identify the shortcomings related to theory, methods, and measures, while identifying best practices. In particular, we offer insights into how future scholarship may meaningfully extend this literature. Finally, we provide evidence-based guidelines for how organizations and their leaders may develop and refine their policies regarding the hiring, promotion, evaluation, and compensation of family members and relatives.",art
10.1002/hrm.22228,"Having fun and thriving: The impact of fun human resource practices on employees' autonomous motivation and thriving at work. Research interest in thriving at work has burgeoned over the past decades, but little is known about how human resource (HR) practices affect employees' thriving at work. Drawing upon self-determination theory and person-organization fit theory, we developed and tested a moderated mediation model to explain how fun HR practices influence employees' thriving at work. The results of two studies, a scenario experiment (N = 164) and a time-lagged survey (N = 253), supported our hypotheses. Specifically, the findings revealed that fun HR practices relates positively to employees' thriving at work. Autonomous motivation partially mediates the abovementioned relationship. Furthermore, fun HR practices translate into higher autonomous motivation and subsequent thriving at work for employees with higher preference for workplace fun. Our research contributes to the existing literature by identifying fun HR practices as an antecedent of thriving at work and revealing the psychological mechanisms through which fun HR practices affect employees' thriving at work. The practical implications, limitations, and future research avenues are also discussed.",art
10.1002/hrm.22167,"Work-role overload, work-life conflict, and perceived career plateau: The moderating role of emotional stability. As perceived career plateau is a prevalent but undesirable state which is harmful to employees and organizations, human resource management (HRM) research has devoted efforts to exploring ways of managing it. However, to date, research has largely been limited to variables that reduce perceived career plateau. There is a need to understand what factors increase these perceptions and how/when they do so, to advance theoretical and practical perspectives. This study contributes to the career plateau literature by investigating how and under what conditions work-role overload can increase employees' perceived career plateau (hierarchical and job content plateaus). Based on a three-wave survey of employees from the service sector of China, we found that work-role overload interacted with employees' trait emotional stability and affected their work-life conflict, which had downstream implications on the two types of perceived career plateaus. Specifically, work-role overload related positively to work-life conflict only when employees had a high (versus low) level of emotional stability. Also, work-life conflict mediated the effects of work-role overload on perceived hierarchical and job content plateaus for employees with high, but not for those with low, emotional stability. These findings provide new insights into how, by taking into account stressful work contexts and individual differences, HRM professionals may intervene to prevent employees from perceiving career plateau.",art
10.1002/hrm.22154,"The self-regulatory consequences of dependence on intelligent machines at work: Evidence from field and experimental studies. Organizations are increasingly augmenting employee jobs with intelligent machines. Although this augmentation has a bright side, in terms of its ability to enhance employee performance, we think there is likely a dark side as well. Draw from self-regulation theory, we theorize that dependence on intelligent machines is discrepancy-reducing-enhancing work goal progress, which in turn boosts employees' task performance. On the other hand, such dependence may be discrepancy-enlarging-threatening employee self-esteem, which in turn detracts from employees' task performance. Drawing further from self-regulation theory, we submit that employees' core self-evaluation (CSE) may influence these effects of dependence on intelligent machines. Across an experience-sampling field study conducted in India (Study 1) and a simulation-based experiment conducted in the United States (Study 2), our results generally support a mixed blessing  perspective of intelligent machines at work. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of our work.",art
10.1002/hrm.22108,"Store leader gender and store sales performance: When and why do women and men underperform?. Finding ways of breaking the gender-based glass ceiling is an important human resource issue in companies today. Employing a sample of over 200 retail stores, we explore multiple moderating and mediating factors to explain when and why women store leaders perform better, equal to, or worse than men. Results reveal that (a) women are assigned to lead stores that are positioned closer to competitive rivals than men and (b) women receive unfair distributive pay outcomes in that they are generally paid less than their male counterparts. When accounting for these factors, performance (i.e., productivity) differences between stores with men and women leaders diminished. Further, organizational tenure and store-unit size (i.e., number of employees) were positively associated with sales performance among stores with women leaders. The findings unveil why some store-units led by women underperform but also offer contingency factors that delineate when women-led and men-led stores excel in sales productivity. Implications for recruiting and retaining both women and men in leadership are considered.",art
10.1002/hrm.22091,"The road taken and the path forward for HR devolution research: An evolutionary review. Devolving HR responsibilities to the line is a distinguishable feature in modern human resource management (HRM). Given its considerable influence on the modus operandi of adopted HRM systems, scholars have delved into barriers to and facilitating conditions of line managers' fulfilling their HR duties and its subsequent outcomes over the past several decades. To deepen our understanding of the current state of the HR devolution literature, we adopt an evolutionary approach that moves beyond a conventional theme-centric review. Exploring the extant literature from a chronological stance offers a unique perspective since such an approach allows us to track and evaluate the development trajectory from its inception. Indeed, our evolutionary review reveals that critical observations on HR devolution practices documented by early studies (e.g., conflicts between line managers and HR professionals) have not been as articulated as they should be in recent endeavors (e.g., focus on line managers' competency and motivation). Through this review, we shed new light on the HR devolution literature and call for revisiting important yet unresolved issues that still resonate today. In addition, we contemplate the future of HR devolution practices amid a changing business landscape and suggest promising research avenues accordingly. By looking back at the road taken and paving the path forward, the current review will offer a guidepost benefiting both aspiring researchers and seasoned scholars in the field.",art
10.1002/hrm.22067,"Who pays the penalty? Implications of gender pay disparities within top management teams for firm performance. Despite the expected advantages of appointing women to corporate leadership roles, empirical evidence provides mixed support for the positive relationship between women's representation in the top management team (TMT) and subsequent firm performance. Considering the evidence that female TMT members are often paid less than their male colleagues, this study examines the implications of a gender pay disparity for the relationship between women's representation in the TMT and firm performance. Our analysis that draws on TMT pay data in public Australian firms demonstrates that gender pay disparities within TMTs negatively moderate the relationship between women's representation in the TMT and subsequent firm performance. Specifically, when female TMT members are paid less than their male colleagues, and this gender pay disparity is large, women's representation in the TMT is negatively associated with firm performance.",art
10.1002/hrm.22060,"Do leaders condone unethical pro-organizational employee behaviors? The complex interplay between leader organizational identification and moral disengagement. Considering recent corporate scandals, organizations have increased their efforts to curb unethical employee behavior. However, little is known about whether leaders comply with these efforts and how they respond to unethical employee behavior, especially when unethical actions benefit the organization. By integrating arguments from social identity and moral disengagement theories, we develop and test a model to explain how leaders respond to unethical pro-organizational behavior (UPB) among employees. Results from one multi-wave, multi-source field study and one experiment showed that leader perceptions of employee UPB were positively related to leader trust in employees when leaders identified strongly with their organization or when they had a strong propensity to morally disengage. Moreover, the results revealed an important three-way interaction effect. Leaders put considerable trust into UPB-enacting employees when leaders both identified strongly with the organization and showed high levels of moral disengagement. In contrast, they put little trust into UPB-enacting employees when leaders identified weakly with the organization and reported low moral disengagement. Furthermore, results showed that leader trust ultimately translated into perceived leader justice toward employees. These findings provide new and important insights into when organizations can(not) rely on their leaders to manage unethical employee behaviors.",art
10.1002/hrm.22237,"Investment in employee developmental climate and employees' continued online learning behaviors: A social influence perspective. In the contemporary digital age, continued online learning behaviors have become indispensable for fostering employee development. However, the learning and development literature predominantly focuses on traditional instructor-led approaches. It remains unclear how organizations can shape employees' learning behaviors, particularly in the context of online learning. The current study clarifies this underexplored research area by investigating how organizational investment in employee developmental climate (IEDC) can promote employees' continued online learning behaviors. Drawing on social influence theory and employing a multilevel research design, we find empirical support for our research model, which specifies that IEDC positively affects employees' continued online learning behaviors through the effect of normative pressure. The findings also reveal the moderating role of online learning facilitating conditions. Specifically, in firms characterized by higher levels of online learning facilitating conditions, the positive relationship between IEDC and normative pressure becomes more pronounced when compared to organizations with lower levels of such facilitating conditions.",art
10.1002/hrm.22217,"Conscientiousness and perceived ethicality: Examining why hierarchy of authority diminishes this positive relationship. Human resource (HR) managers hire conscientious employees because they are both productive and are viewed as upholding high ethical standards due to their propensity to engage in voice. Organizations may strive to create a work context conducive to all employees acting ethically, not just conscientious ones, by centralizing decision-making authority and promoting formalization through a higher hierarchy of authority. Yet, we propose that from the social information processing perspective, in higher hierarchy of authority contexts, peers may view their highly conscientious colleagues as less ethical. We hypothesize these effects through the lens of trait activation theory, according to which in a higher hierarchy of authority context, others are less likely to notice the voice behaviors of conscientious employees. Problematically, when others fail to notice conscientious employees' voice, they may perceive these workers as being less ethical. We tested our hypothesized moderated mediation model in a matched sample of employees (N = 820), their supervisors (N = 445), and peers (N = 529). As predicted, hierarchy of authority moderated the positive relationship between conscientiousness and voice, which in turn explained others' perceptions of their ethicality. Conscientiousness was positively related to peer assessments of ethicality via promotive (not prohibitive) voice when hierarchy of authority was lower (but not higher), partially supporting our hypotheses. These results suggest HR practitioners should be cognizant of the differential evaluations of highly conscientious employees in contexts with different levels of hierarchy of authority, and continuing challenges associated with balancing flexibility and formalization.",art
10.1002/hrm.22199,"Put your own oxygen mask on first: A behavioral typology of leaders' self-care. Organizational leaders are essential in implementing, interpreting, and even proactively initiating changes for human resource (HR) functions to enhance workplace productivity and well-being. However, recent studies have cautioned that providing positive and supportive leadership usually drains these organizational leaders. Although the literature has shed light on how leaders can use self-care strategies to recharge, researchers and HR professionals know relatively little about (1) what specific self-care actions leaders can take and (2) how external crises such as COVID-19 constrain leaders' self-care actions. To identify specific leaders' self-care behaviors, which we refer to as oxygen masks, we interviewed 41 healthcare managers in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. We presented a behavioral typology summarizing distinct oxygen masks that leaders used at different points in time. These oxygen masks include improving physical well-being, improving emotional/spiritual/social well-being, fulfilling managerial roles, and seeking collegial and organizational support. Moreover, we concluded that the COVID-19 restrictions made some of these oxygen masks less accessible, negatively impacting leaders' well-being. Our research conclusions have implications for theory and future studies on extending the literature associated with leadership development, leaders' resilience, and leaders' well-being. The results also provide HR professionals with practical suggestions about assisting line managers in improving their self-care and sustaining their leadership effectiveness.",art
10.1002/hrm.22160,"High performance work systems and employee mental health: The roles of psychological empowerment, work role overload, and organizational identification. Employee mental health is a central issue in today's global workplace. This paper analyzes the effect of high performance work systems (HPWSs) on employee mental health. We integrate HPWS concepts with job demands-resources (JD-R) theory to examine competing theoretical perspectives-a positive HPWS influence and a negative HPWS influence on employee mental health. We examine employees' perceptions of psychological empowerment as an indicator of the motivational pathway of the JD-R and work-role overload as an indicator of the strain pathway to explain the differential effect of HPWSs on mental health. We also incorporate organizational identification theory to demonstrate how one's identification with the organization can either accentuate or attenuate feelings of both psychological empowerment and work-role overload. Findings from a study of 999 employees in 174 South Korean organizations indicate that HPWSs are positively associated with employee mental health via employee perceptions of empowerment and that HPWSs are negatively associated with employee mental health through perceptions of work-role overload. Furthermore, the study finds that organizational identification attenuates the relationship between HPWS and both empowerment and overload. Practice-level post hoc analyses also reveal that the job design characteristics, pay level, and participative decision-making are linked to empowerment. In addition, participative decision-making is most strongly associated with work overload.",art

10.1108/PR-03-2023-0222,"Examining employee experiences of hybrid work: an ecological approach. Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the various forms of organizational and team-level actions that were perceived to be helpful or not helpful by employees as they navigate the hybrid work arrangements and how these had an impact on their work behaviors and experiences. This research utilized Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory as framework. Design/methodology/approach - The exploratory study used a qualitative approach in gathering data via online survey from a total of 45 Filipino employees working in a hybrid work arrangement for at least three months. The analysis utilized both inductive and deductive methodologies in examining the data. Inductive thematic analysis was used in coding the data based on the participants' responses, while the deductive approach ensured that the themes are aligned with the research questions and reflect the different systems within Bronfenbrenner's EST (1986). Findings - Results surfaced helpful organizational (e.g. provision of work tools, financial assistance, supportive policies and engagement and wellness initiatives) and team level actions (i.e. use of technologybased communication tools, open virtual door policy, effective performance management system, employee care practices and team engagement activities). Actions that were perceived as not helpful include inadequate technological infrastructure, poor communication, insufficient training, punitive policies/practices and leadership issues at the organizational level as well as unresponsive colleagues and ineffective implementation of policies/processes at the level of teams. Employees reported being able to build on savings, becoming more productive and having greater work-life balance amid hybrid work. However, they continue to be challenged by blurred boundaries and inability to disconnect from work similar to when work was done remotely and now with sustaining momentum given the shifts on where they do their work. Practical implications - The findings of this study may guide programs and initiatives of human resource management practitioners and organizational leaders as they support employees in navigating through hybrid work. Originality/value - The research expands extant knowledge on practices and experiences in hybrid work (Gifford, 2022). It also contributes to studies on human resource management that are nuanced based on where work is performed (Ng and Stanton, 2023) or with emerging work arrangements.",art

Purpose - Within the theoretical frameworks of conservation of resources and job demands-resources (JD-R), the study aims to examine how sleep deficit could be negatively related to creativity at work by depleting critical resources of creativity.Design/methodology/approach - The survey data were collected from 368 individuals nested in 40 teams at a call center. The authors conducted multilevel analysis to test the proposed hypotheses to account for the hierarchical nature of the data while simultaneously estimating the effect of predictors at different levels on individual-level outcomes and maintaining the predictors' level of analysis.Findings - Through the data, the study presents how the depletion of resource, that is, emotional exhaustion, functions as a mediating mechanism that connects sleep deficit to creativity at work. Further, the study presents that higher job demands can worsen the negative effects of resource depletion on creativity at work because they further deplete resources needed for creative behaviors. Specifically, when sleep-deprived, those working in a high-task-interdependence climate are likely to experience emotional exhaustion more severely than do those in a low- task-interdependence climate. Also, the relationship between emotional exhaustion and creativity is more negative for managers than for non- managers because of managers' higher job demands.Practical implications - By presenting sleep deficit-linked inhibitors of creativity at work, the authors highlight the importance of securing sufficient sleep and affective resources when designing jobs and HR practices in organizations.Originality/value - This paper addresses the call for attention to examining the mechanisms through which sleep deficit affects employee creative behavior.",art

Purpose How to manage outsourced employees in interorganizational teams with triangular relationships has not yet attracted enough attention. Based on relative deprivation theory, this study explores how relative deprivation affects outsourced employees' innovative behavior and investigates the complex moderating effects of dual organizational support. Design/methodology/approach The authors tested their hypothesis by conducting a two-wave survey; responses to a questionnaire were collected from 283 outsourced employees and their managers among 52 client organizations. Findings Results found that relative deprivation negatively influences the outsourced employees' innovative behavior by eliciting their perceptions of status conflict. Support from client (supplier) organization attenuates (aggravates) the positive impact of relative deprivation on innovative behavior throughout status conflict. The moderating effect of client organizational support was moderated by support from supplier organization. Research limitations/implications The authors selected the outsourced employees in a Chinese context to conduct this study, and the results need to be generalized in future research. Practical implications Client organizational support can alleviate the negative effect of relative deprivation on outsourced employees, whereas supplier organization support aggravates the negative effect; managers should pay attention to the different effects of the two organizations' support and provide reasonable support for outsourced employees.

10.1108/PR-03-2021-0215,"Emotional exhaustion, emotional intelligence and task performance of employees in educational institutions during COVID 19 global pandemic: a moderated-mediation model. Purpose The objective of the present study is to investigate the relationship between emotional exhaustion and performance. During the present coronavirus disease (COVID-19) global pandemic, as the world has come to a standstill and more than 200 countries have been seriously affected, the level of emotional exhaustion experienced by people worldwide is beyond one's imagination. But how organizations were coping with emotional exhaustion and maintaining performance has remained an important question. To address this, the authors developed a conceptual model suggesting that organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) can act as a mediator, and leadership style and emotional intelligence (EI) can act as moderators in alleviating the dysfunctional consequences of emotional exhaustion. Design/methodology/approach Using a structured survey instrument, data were collected from 384 respondents from the faculty and administrative personnel in the Mangalore Diocese educational institutions. The authors used stratified sampling and tested the psychometric properties of the instrument using Lisrel software. To test the hypotheses involving two-way and three-way interactions, the authors used Hayes (2018) PROCESS as a statistical technique. Findings The results revealed that OCB mediated the relationship between emotional exhaustion and performance. To alleviate the dysfunctional consequences of emotional exhaustion, EI and transformational leadership interact to influence OCBs. The authors found that at lower and higher levels of EI, employees exhibited OCBs when leaders exhibited a greater level of transformational leadership. Furthermore, the transactional leadership style interacted with emotional exhaustion to reduce the adverse effects of later on performance. Research limitations/implications As with any research based on self-report measures, the present study has inherent limitations of social desirability and common method bias. However, the authors have sufficient care to minimize, if not eliminate, these limitations. The research highlights the importance of EI, a contingency leadership style in organizations, to reduce the adverse effects of emotional exhaustion caused by the global pandemic. Practical implications This study contributes to both organizations and literature on personnel psychology and organizational behavior. The study suggests that individuals need to invest resources in developing the skills of controlling and regulating their emotions and engaging in extra-role behaviors. In addition, leaders in organizations need to exercise transformational and transactional leadership styles to combat the present COVID-19 global pandemic situation. Originality/value This study provides new insights into the importance of EI, leadership style, and OCBs in restoring the loss of resources because of emotional exhaustion. The conceptual model developed and tested is the first of its kind in India, to our knowledge, and contributes to both theory and practice.",art
10.1108/PR-03-2020-0164,"Give full play to the talent: exploring when perceived overqualification leads to more altruistic helping behavior through extra effort. Purpose This paper aims to build a moderate mediation model to delineate when and how employee with perceived overqualification will exert extra effort and therefore engage in more altruistic helping behavior. Design/methodology/approach The research hypotheses were empirically tested using multitime and multisource survey data. Given the nested nature of data (i.e. 52 immediate supervisors rated 143 subordinates), multilevel structural equation modeling analyses within Mplus were conducted to test the proposed model. Findings The results support the proposed moderated mediation effect and indicate that perceived overqualification is positively related to extra effort on a condition that there is either strong desire for higher workplace status or more developmental job opportunities. The extra effort will subsequently lead to more altruistic helping behavior. Practical implications Based on the findings of this paper, human resource managers should consider the job applicant's desire for workplace status and the organizational context the employer can provide when hiring overqualified employees. Second, organizations should carefully conduct job design to improve overqualified employees' on-the-job developmental experiences. Third, training programs should be conducted to help satisfy needs and improve workplace status of overqualified employees, so that they can exert extra job effort and engage in pro-organizational behaviors. Originality/value Drawing on motivation-opportunity-ability theory, this paper extends the limited understanding of important boundary conditions under which perceived overqualification can be beneficial.

Purpose This paper develops and tests a model for managing workplace bullying by integrating employee perceived servant leadership, resilience and proactive personality. Specifically, this paper explores servant leadership as an inhibitive factor for workplace bullying, both directly and indirectly in the presence of employee resilience as a mediator. It further explores whether proactive personality moderates the indirect relationship. Design/methodology/approach This is an empirical study based on analysis of survey data collected from 408 employees working in services and manufacturing sector organisations in Pakistan. Structural equation modelling was used to test the research model. Findings Structural equation modelling results support the proposition that servant leadership helps in discouraging workplace bullying, both directly and indirectly, in the presence of employee resilience as a mediator. However, employee proactive personality moderates this process, such that the association between resilience and workplace bullying is stronger for individuals with high proactive personality. Research limitations/implications This study's findings illuminate the strong potential of servant leadership for managing workplace bullying. This potential is attributed to positive role modelling in the workplace, which may assist in building followers' resilience. This study provides evidence to support the importance of leadership in the process by which employees develop better psychological resources to combat bullying at work. Originality/value This is the first study that examines the direct relationship between servant leadership and bullying at work. In addition, this study introduced the mediating effect of resilience and the moderating effect of proactive personality on this relationship.",art

Purpose The main aim of this study is to explore the moderating role of ethical leadership on the indirect effect of work-family conflict on nurses' job satisfaction via hindrance stress. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire was answered by 224 nursing professionals working in public and private health institutions. Findings A mediation-moderation model was estimated, and the results thereof indicated that work-family conflict has an indirect negative effect on satisfaction through the mediation mechanism of hindrance stress. Results also show that ethical leadership enhances this mediated relationship. Research limitations/implications The cross-sectional data limited the generalization of results. Future research should develop longitudinal studies, which will allow for conclusions to be drawn with regard to inferences of causality. Practical implications It is recommended that health organizations should develop ethical training for their leaders. By doing so, they will address two issues: the conciliation between work and family as well as the reduction of job stress, which will subsequently improve job satisfaction. Originality/value The originality of this empirical study lies in the exploration of the moderating role of ethical leadership in the indirect effect of work-family conflict, which, in turn, impacts on job satisfaction via the hindrance stress experienced by nurses.

Purpose The purpose of this article is to investigate the unexplored relationship between employees' perceptions that they have made compromises in their careers (i.e. perceived career compromise) and their turnover intentions, as well as how it might be moderated by two personal factors (materialism and idealism) and two contextual factors (abusive supervision and decision autonomy). Design/methodology/approach Survey data were collected among employees who work in the education sector in Canada. Findings Employees' frustrations about unwanted career adjustments lead to an enhanced desire to leave their organization. This process is more likely among employees who are materialistic and suffer from verbally abusive leaders, but it is less likely among those who are idealistic and have more decision autonomy. Practical implications For human resource managers, these results provide novel insights into the individual and contextual circumstances in which frustrations about having to compromise career goals may escalate into the risk that valuable employees quit. Originality/value This study contributes to human resource management research by detailing the conditional effects of a hitherto overlooked determinant of employees' turnover intentions, namely, their beliefs about a discrepancy between their current career situation and their personal aspirations.",art
10.1108/PR-01-2024-0041,"Does voluntarism work for the workplace inclusion of individuals with disabilities in a country with limited equality structures?. PurposeThe study explores measures designed explicitly to manage people with disabilities in a context where diversity interventions are incorporated voluntarily. Furthermore, it examines global organizations' approaches to marginalized groups, such as people with disabilities, in a context where there is an explicit lack of state regulation on diversity measures.Design/methodology/approachAn abductive approach was adopted for the exploratory nature, which sought to understand how global organizations in a developing country utilize diversity management mechanisms to manage people with disabilities.FindingsThe findings reveal that human resources departments of international organizations operating in a neoliberal environment demonstrate two distinct perspectives for individuals with disabilities: (i) inclusiveness due to legal pressures and (ii) social exclusion.Originality/valueWe explored global organizations' approaches to marginalized groups, such as people with disabilities, in the context of an explicit lack of state regulation on diversity measures and showed that the absence of coercive regulation leads to voluntary actions with adverse consequences. The paper expands theories that critique the inclusion of individuals with disabilities in untamed neoliberal contexts and explains how the responsibilization of institutional actors could enhance what is practical and possible for the workplace inclusion of individuals with disabilities. Without such institutional responsibilization, our findings reveal that disability inclusion is left to the limited prospects of the market rationales to the extent of bottom-line utility.",art

PurposeThis manuscript explores the evolving roles of HR professionals amidst global megatrends and organizational transitions, focusing on the Italian context, which has experienced disruptive adoption of new forms of work such as remote and hybrid work. In this challenging scenario, our research aims to uncover if and how HR professionals are transforming their roles or maintaining the status quo in navigating organizational changes, dealing with the upcoming working scenario, and challenging conventional perceptions of HR practitioners.Design/methodology/approachThe study employs the social-symbolic work lens, that contributes to a deeper understanding of how HR professionals work to construct organizational life, the identities of employees, and the societal norms and assumptions that provide the context for organizational action. This perspective highlights HR professionals' personal efforts, consisting of the emotional labor entailed in steering organizational transformations and, eventually, maintenance in a context where remote work has become prevalent. Data was collected through 16 online focus groups involving 76 HR professionals from Italian organizations.FindingsOur research offers two interrelated contributions to HR literature. First, we provide pieces of evidence on how HR practitioners act as agents of change in two emerging roles: the Wannabe Hero and the Ordinary Hero. This challenges the prevailing rhetorical discourse about the so-called HR business partner. Secondly, we delve into the persistent obstacles that hinder HR professionals from making a substantial impact in addressing radical changes. These findings will provide useful insights into effectively engaging HR practitioners as agents of change in organizational transformation, shedding light on praxis, structures, and their emotional work.Originality/valueThe paper analyzes HR professionals' social-symbolic work, which offers an original contribution to the comprehension of the activities they carry on in practice and the emotions they have been experiencing. These influence both the way HR professionals play their role and the organizational and institutional environment.",art

PurposeThe present study aims to gauge the experience of gender non-binary (NB) employees in the context of employee value propositions (EVP) in Indian enterprises and make suggestions for organizations to align their gender-aligned interventions with the EVP framework.Design/methodology/approachQualitative methodology was used for collecting data through semi-structured interviews and subsequent analysis of the transcripts. The data was gathered from 10 NB participants working in Indian enterprises with the use of non-probabilistic purposive snowball sampling.FindingsThe analysis revealed eight themes representing the good, bad and ugly experiences of NB individuals within the context of EVP. These findings underscore the potential of enriching value propositions for employees to promote gender inclusion in corporate settings, contributing to long-term organizational success.Practical implicationsThe study offers both theoretical and practical implications for fostering inclusivity at the workplace. It suggests that policymakers and organizations should align EVP with diversity and inclusion initiatives, re-evaluate hiring processes and promotion policies to ensure equal opportunities for NB individuals, provide regular staff training to address biases and implement inclusive insurance policies and representation in employee resource groups (ERGs).Originality/valueThis study provides unique insights into the experiences of NB employees within the framework of EVPs in Indian organizations.",art

PurposeThis study aims to contribute knowledge about different professional identities represented among HR practitioners from Weber's ideal types framework.Design/methodology/approachThe paper is based on semi-structured interviews with 34 Swedish HR practitioners working in large public and private organisations.FindingsThe findings reveal that HR practitioners' identity is perceived as indistinct, unclear and shattered, which leaves lots of room for interpreting HR identity. Based on a thematic content analysis, three different ideal-type identities are presented, each representing the characteristic traits of an HR identity type. These are the Defender who always supports the managers, the Disturber who questions the managers in favour of the employees and the Driver who focuses on the economic expansion of the organisation.Research limitations/implicationsOne of the potential constraints of this study is the authors' reliance on interview data. This finding implies that future research can employ mixed methods or observational techniques to bridge the gap between narrated responsibilities and real-time actions. The data source, predominantly from larger organisations, presents another limitation. This raises a significant research implication: there is a need to study identity formation among HR practitioners in smaller organisations. The theoretical framework this study contributes can aid in comprehending HR practitioners' identities and their corresponding actions. Continued research might explore the significance of these ideal-type identities.Practical implicationsThe model presented provides a new way of understanding HR practitioners' complex and shattered professional identity and the various stakeholders that direct different expectations towards them. This knowledge can be used both in HR education and in HR work as a basis for discussing the social work environment of HR practitioners and negotiating their work and identity.Originality/valueThe study contributes knowledge of the professional identities of HR managers, an under-researched area, especially when it comes to empirical research about the HR practitioners' own experiences of their everyday work and view of the HR profession.",art
10.1108/PR-11-2022-0832,"Bots for mental health: the boundaries of human and technology agencies for enabling mental well-being within organizations. PurposeThe importance of mental wellbeing and the need for organizations to address it is increasing in the post-pandemic context. Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being adopted in HRM functions, its adoption and utility for enabling mental wellbeing is limited. Building on the Open System Theory (OST) and adopting the technology-in-practice lens, the authors examined the roles of human and technology agencies in enabling mental wellbeing.Design/methodology/approachThe study was conducted in two stages; in Stage 1, the authors adopted a case methodology approach to examine the feasibility of a technology company's offerings to assess mental wellbeing. In Stage 2, the authors followed the grounded theory approach and interviewed 22 key stakeholders and HR leaders of diverse organizations. The authors used Gioia's approach to analyze the data.FindingsThe study demonstrates the interdependence and inseparability of human activity, technological capability and structured context. Specifically, the authors observe that AI adoption is pushing the boundaries of how organizations could support employees' mental health and wellbeing. These technological advancements and adoption are likely to facilitate the evolution of agentic practices, routines and structures.Research limitations/implicationsThis study carries two important implications. While the advent of cutting-edge technologies appears to affect employees' mental wellbeing, the study findings indicate the assistive role of technology in supporting mental wellbeing and facilitating changes in organizational practices. Second, the ontology of technology-in-practice shows how human-machine agencies gain newer relevance from the interactions that unite them. Specifically, per OST, technology (from an external context) can potentially change how mental wellbeing practices in organizations are managed. The authors extend the existing literature by suggesting that both human agents and internal contexts effectively limit the potential of technology agents to change existing structures significantly.Originality/valueThe authors address the need for more research on the technology-management interface, and the boundaries of technology-enabled wellbeing at work. While AI-HRM scholarship has primarily relied on micro-level psychological theories to examine impact and outcomes, the authors borrow from the macro-level theories, such as the OST and the technology-in-practice to explain how AI is shifting the boundaries of human and machine agencies for enabling mental wellbeing.",art

PurposeThe study aims to understand the phenomenon of workplace ostracism from multiple perspectives (target, perpetrator and observer). The understanding of the phenomenon is used to thematically analyse the antecedents of workplace ostracism and identify appropriate strategies for each antecedent.Design/methodology/approachThe study findings are based on face-to-face semi-structured interviews with thirty-three senior and medium-level employees from various public and private sector organizations in India. The interview transcripts were systematically analyzed to identify antecedents of ostracism, which were inductively grouped together based on similarity.FindingsThe antecedents of workplace ostracism were grouped into four major heads: perceived non-alignment with organizational needs; emotional reaction; unconscious social processes and structural and demographic differences. Based on interview transcripts, strategies to reduce the effect of each of the broad antecedents of ostracism were identified.Practical implicationsWorkplace ostracism has been linked with multiple negative outcomes including increased stress and turnover intention. The study provides managers with a framework that enables them to evaluate and understand incidences of ostracism among their subordinates. The study also equips managers with the knowledge of specific strategies for dealing with specific antecedents of ostracism.Originality/valueThe study answers the need to look at the phenomenon of ostracism through multiple perspectives. It identifies multiple potentially new antecedents and strategies to deal with workplace ostracism and groups them in a coherent manner. It is among the few studies on ostracism in India and extends the generalizability of the construct.",art

PurposeDrawing on the conservation of resources (COR) theory, this study examined the mediating role of psychological availability in the relationships between principals' individual-level and group-level authentic leadership and individual teachers' wellbeing, that is, job satisfaction, life satisfaction and emotional exhaustion.Design/methodology/approachThe authors conducted a three-wave online questionnaire survey among 266 teachers from 52 schools in China. Multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) was used to analyze the hypothesized relationships among the study variables.FindingsThe principals' group-level and individual-level authentic leadership were both positively associated with individual teachers' psychological availability, which in turn was positively related to their job satisfaction and life satisfaction, and negatively related to their emotional exhaustion.Practical implicationsSchool administrations should elevate the levels of principals' authentic leadership by selecting and developing authentic principals to increase teacher wellbeing.Originality/valueDiffering from prior research that has focused on the effect of authentic leadership at either group-level or individual-level, this study simultaneously investigated the dual-level effects of principals' authentic leadership. Moreover, psychological availability was found to mediate the dual-level effects of principals' authentic leadership on teachers' job satisfaction, life satisfaction and emotional exhaustion.",art
10.1108/PR-09-2021-0690,"Health services in Australia and the impact of antiquated rostering practices on medical scientists: a case for HR analytics and evidenced-based human resource management. Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the rostering practices and work experiences of medical scientists at four health services in the Australian public healthcare sector. There are over 16,000 medical scientists (AIHW, 2019) in Australia responsible for carrying out pathology testing to help save the lives of thousands of patients every day. However, there are systemic shortages of medical scientists largely due to erratic rostering practices and workload issues. The purpose of this paper is to integrate evidence-based human resource management (EBHRM), the LAMP model and HR analytics to enhance line manager decision-making on rostering to support the wellbeing of medical scientists. Design/methodology/approach Using a qualitative methodological approach, the authors conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with managers/directors and nine focus groups with 53 medical scientists, making a total 74 participants from four large public hospitals in Australia. Findings Across four health services, manual systems of rostering and management decisions do not meet the requirements of the enterprise agreement (EA) and impact negatively on the wellbeing of medical scientists in pathology services. The authors found no evidence of the systematic approach of the organisations and line managers to implement the LAMP model to understand the root causes of rostering challenges and negative impact on employees. Moreover, there was no evidence of sophisticated use of HR analytics or EBHRM to support line managers' decision-making regarding mitigation of rostering related challenges such as absenteeism and employee turnover. Originality/value The authors contribute to HRM theory by integrating EBHRM, the LAMP model (Boudreau and Ramstad, 2007) and HR analytics to inform line management decision-making. The authors advance understandings of how EBHRM incorporating the LAMP model and HR analytics can provide a systematic and robust process for line managers to make informed decisions underpinned by data.",art
10.1108/PR-10-2021-0734,"Does motivation matter? How leader behaviors influence employee vigor at work. Purpose This study supposes to provide new insights into the role of leader behaviors in motivating employees by examining how and when spiritual leadership and contingent reward leadership facilitate employee vigor at work. Design/methodology/approach Drawing from self-determination theory (SDT), the current study proposes that spiritual leadership intrinsically motivates employees, whereas contingent reward leadership extrinsically motivates employees - both of which subsequently improve employee vigor at work. The theoretical model was tested through a sample of 191 employees collected across three time points in China. Findings Results revealed that spiritual leadership positively facilitates employee vigor at work through enhancing their work enjoyment, and employees' need for achievement can amplify the effects of spiritual leadership. In addition, employees' performance-reward expectancy transmits the effects of contingent reward leadership on employee vigor at work, and leaders' performance expectations play a key role in strengthening the positive influences of contingent reward leadership. Originality/value Based on SDT, this study provides a comprehensive explanation of how and when two patterns of leader behaviors affect employee vigor at work. Therefore, the authors provide significant insights for leadership and work design in human resource management.",art
10.1108/PR-07-2020-0510,"The role of individual characteristics and working conditions in understanding boredom at work. Purpose This study proposes an examination of the psychometric properties of the French version of two boredom scales (i.e. the Dutch Boredom Scale and the Boredom Proneness Scale Short Version), the antecedents of boredom at work, based on an integrative theoretical framework drawing on the Job Demand-Resources model (Bakker and Demerouti, 2017) and the moderating effects of individual characteristics on the relation between contextual antecedents and boredom at work. Design/methodology/approach This study was based on a cross-sectional design with a sample of 363 Swiss workers. First, the two boredom scales were validated through a confirmatory factor analysis. Then, in order to study the relative strength of the predictors of boredom at work, a hierarchical regression model was tested. Finally, the interaction effects between individual characteristics and contextual antecedents of boredom at work were tested. Findings Factor analyses revealed a unidimensional structure for both instruments. Regression results showed that boredom proneness, job demands, job autonomy and social utility added a significant percentage of incremental variance to the model. Moreover, a significant interaction between contextual and individual characteristics in predicting boredom at work was observed. Practical implications Our findings stress the importance of taking into account employees' experiences at work when developing job design interventions to promote well-balanced working conditions for all, as well as targeted solutions for specific populations, in order to adequately address the issue of boredom in the workplace. Originality/value This study explores the relatively under-researched topic of boredom at work, known to be detrimental for individuals and organizations. To date, research on its antecedents has been quite fragmented and we particularly contribute to the literature by investigating this aspect.",art

Purpose The objective of this study is to analyze the relationship between leaders' forgiveness and organizational performance using radical innovation as an explanatory variable. Design/methodology/approach The study was conducted in a sample frame of 11,594 Spanish companies. A total of 600 valid questionnaires were obtained. The structural equations were used to validate the proposed hypotheses. Findings Results confirmed the hypotheses proposed in the model: the authors provided, through structural equations, empirical evidence of the relationship between leaders' forgiveness and organizational performance, mediated by radical innovation. Leaders' forgiveness promotes radical innovation and, in turn, performance. Research limitations/implications The sample of companies is heterogeneous in terms of firm turnover, size and age. The study is focused on radical innovation. Practical implications The present study may help to develop more humane policies to manage human resources, by taking into account employees' feelings and needs. Originality/value The business field is closer to competitive values and has traditionally underestimated the importance of leaders' forgiveness. This is one of the few studies that empirically analyze the consequences of leaders' forgiveness within organizations.",art
10.1002/hrm.22252,"Predicting and Explaining Assessment Center Judgments: A Cross-Validated Behavioral Approach to Performance Judgments in Interpersonal Assessment Center Exercises. Although Assessment Center (AC) role-play assessments have received ample attention in past research, their reliance on actual behavioral information is still unclear. Uncovering the behavioral basis of AC role-play assessments is, however, a prerequisite for the optimization of existing and the development of novel automated AC procedures. This work provides a first data-driven benchmark for the behavioral prediction and explanation of AC performance judgments. We used machine learning models trained on behavioral cues (C = 36) to predict performance judgments in three interpersonal AC exercises from a real-life high-stakes AC (selection of medical students, N = 199). Three main findings emerged: First, behavioral prediction models showed substantial predictive performance and outperformed prediction models representing potential judgment biases. Comparisons with in-sample results revealed overfitting of traditional approaches, highlighting the importance of out-of-sample evaluations. Second, we demonstrate that linear combinations of behavioral cues can be strong predictors of assessors' judgments. Third, we identified consistent exercise-specific patterns of individual cues and cross-exercise consistent behavioral patterns of behavioral dimensions and interpersonal strategies that were especially predictive of the assessors' judgments. We discuss implications for future research and practice.",art

10.1002/hrm.22161,"Effective communication for relational coordination in remote work: How job characteristics and HR practices shape user-technology interactions. The theory of relational coordination holds that frequent, timely, accurate, and problem-solving communication positively interacts with relationships of mutual respect, shared goals, and shared knowledge to support effective work coordination. With increasing numbers of employees working remotely, Advanced Communication Technologies (ACTs) are crucial for enabling the communication necessary for relational coordination. To investigate how organizations can maintain effective communication between employees in remote work settings, we conducted 47 interviews across multiple organizations. We find that users enact different affordances, that is, action possibilities, of the same material features of an ACT. Enacting these affordances supports frequent, timely, accurate, and problem-solving communication when working remotely. Which affordances users enact varies systematically with job characteristics. Specifically, users whose jobs have high levels of task variety, autonomy, creative problem solving, and interdependence across teams enact more of the affordances that enable effective communication. Comprehensive ACTs that integrate all communication features into one technology and rules requesting the company-wide exclusive interaction with this ACT strengthen the relationship between users' job characteristics and affordance enactment. Our findings show that it is important to involve HRM from the outset so that, in close cooperation with IT, a system can be found that-supported by suitable sets of rules-enables effective communication.",art

This study draws from brand positioning research to introduce the notions of points-of-relevance and points-of-difference to employer image research. Similar to prior research, this means that we start by investigating the relevant image attributes (points-of-relevance) that potential applicants use for judging organizations' attractiveness as an employer. However, we go beyond past research by examining whether the same points-of-relevance are used within and across industries. Next, we further extend current research by identifying which of the relevant image attributes also serve as points-of-difference for distinguishing between organizations and industries. The sample consisted of 24 organizations from 6 industries (total N = 7171). As a first key result, across industries and organizations, individuals attached similar importance to the same instrumental (job content, working conditions, and compensation) and symbolic (innovativeness, gentleness, and competence) image attributes in judging organizational attractiveness. Second, organizations and industries varied significantly on both instrumental and symbolic image attributes, with job content and innovativeness emerging as the strongest points-of-difference. Third, most image attributes showed greater variation between industries than between organizations, pointing at the importance of studying employer image at the industry level. Implications for recruitment research, employer branding, and best employer competitions are discussed.",art
10.1002/hrm.22086,"The performance impact of gender diversity in the top management team and board of directors: A multiteam systems approach. Given the mixed evidence that having both women and men in the top management team (TMT) or in the board of directors (BOD) has a significant influence on organizational innovation, we resolve this issue by conceptualizing TMT-BOD gender diversity as part of a multiteam system, that has joint effects which impact organizational innovation. Evidence from the study of both Chinese firms and UK firms confirm our conceptualization by showing an interaction effect between TMT gender diversity and BOD gender diversity such that innovation is greatest when both are high. The positive TMT-BOD gender diversity interaction effect on innovation improves subsequent firm performance particularly in dynamic environments. The findings refine current thinking by going beyond research that tests intra-team TMT or BOD diversity independently and instead considers inter-team diversity across both leadership teams within the strategic leadership upper echelons. In sum, findings show that high levels of TMT and BOD gender diversity result in more organizational innovation, which ultimately improves firm performance. We offer implications for women's inclusion in leadership as well as for research on the upper echelons.",art

Employee ownership is an important governance tool used to encourage employee participation and enhance employee productivity, but we know little about what encourages employee ownership. This study investigates the influence of chief executive officer (CEO) positive framing in public speeches on employee ownership. We propose that CEO positive framing can increase employee ownership when employees internalize CEOs' positive beliefs about firms' accomplishments and prospects. Using a sample of 664 U.S. listed firms from 2002 to 2018, we find that CEO positive framing increases employee ownership. In addition, the stock purchasing behaviors of top executives, analyst recommendations, and positive media coverage strengthen the effectiveness of CEOs' positive framing on employee ownership.

Growing recognition of neurodivergence amongst individuals poses challenges for career counselors and human resource practitioners when advising, guiding, and supporting the careers of this diverse group. Despite the potential for neurodivergent individuals to contribute to organizations, career guidance for these individuals is a relatively new area. We conducted a multidisciplinary project comprising a scoping review and stakeholder consultation to generate evidence-based recommendations for identifying and supporting career paths that lead to positive employment outcomes for neurodivergent individuals. The scoping review included 78 articles on career guidance and associated employment issues (e.g., facilitators and barriers to employment) for neurodivergent individuals, while stakeholders, including neurodivergent individuals, counselors, and others, provided insights into their employment experiences. Our scoping review yielded nine themes: career guidance practice, predictors of employment, employment interventions, different forms of employment, work barriers and facilitators, strengths and challenges, person-job fit, occupation and industry fit, and employment outcomes. The stakeholder consultations complemented the scholarly themes. Results were interpreted using the Stone and Colella theoretical model of factors influencing the treatment of people with disabilities. The model was extended across educational and work contexts, and to include the nature of occupations and industries. Building on this project and our overarching theoretical model, we map a future research agenda for the study of careers amongst neurodivergent individuals. Specifically, we highlight persistent methodological limitations of the literature before turning to theoretical implications across career stages. We conclude with practical implications for career counselors and human resource practitioners. Ultimately, our review calls for researchers and practitioners to help promote sustainable, high-quality, and fulfilling careers for neurodivergent individuals.",art

Using a sample of 414 CEO successions in family firms listed on China's stock exchanges during 2008-2016, we find an insurance-like effect of both sustainable HRM and corporate philanthropy in enhancing firm performance of family CEO successors. Our results also show that firms with family CEO successors will outperform those with nonfamily counterparts under conditions of high employee compensation, low top management team (TMT) compensation, and long TMT tenure. Our findings suggest that sustainable HRM and corporate philanthropy complement rather than substitute in strengthening family leadership during CEO succession.",art
10.1002/hrm.22121,"Incongruous employer brand signals and organizational attractiveness: Evidence from multinational companies in China. In an era of information explosion, employers' information is often disclosed to employees and potential applicants from multiple channels and angles, which are usually combinations of positive and negative signals. How do such uncoordinated brand signals affect the attractiveness of an organization? Building on micro-corporate social responsibility (CSR) literature and three studies, we found that when potential employees perceived imbalanced brand signals of CSR and corporate ability, the positive impact of CSR on organizational attractiveness was strengthened when the company was weaker in its corporate ability. When they perceived conflicting brand signals of corporate social irresponsibility (CSiR) and corporate ability, the negative impact of CSiR on organizational attractiveness was strengthened when the company was stronger in its corporate ability. Supplementary analyses also demonstrated a significant three-way interaction among CSR, CSiR, and corporate ability. When such conflicting brand signals were presented, CSR weakened CSiR's negative impact when corporate ability was stronger. However, when corporate ability was weaker, CSR strengthened the negative impact of CSiR on organizational attractiveness. Our study offers guidance for companies with mixed employer brand signals and suggests enhancing applicant attraction via synergy among a company's public relations, human resources, and marketing functions.",art
10.1002/hrm.22058,"Investigating employee and organizational performance in a cross-border acquisition-A case of withdrawal behavior. Over the last two decades, performance management systems (PMSs) have been the focus of increasing attention. However, scant research has examined the link between individual- and organizational-level performance in the context of cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Employee withdrawal adversely affects organizations, and has thus been associated with negative consequences for organizations and regarded as a counterproductive work behavior. Our article presents an empirical investigation of determinants and consequences of employee withdrawal, and its impact on willingness to share tacit knowledge, knowledge transfer, and cross-border acquisition performance in the context of Chinese acquisitions in the UK. Based on a cross-sectional survey of 103 employees of an UK subsidiary and Chinese acquiring firm, we found that trust in the acquiring firm significantly reduces acquired firm employee withdrawal behaviors. Moreover, our findings indicate that employee withdrawal behaviors negatively impact employee willingness to share tacit knowledge. The findings further confirm that such willingness positively influences knowledge transfer, which, in turn, has a positive effect on cross border acquisition performance. Our article contributes to the PMS literature by enhancing the understanding of the process through which human resource management systems affect outcomes at different levels of analysis in the context of the cross-border acquisitions.",art

We draw on job demands-resources theory to develop and test a model that explores the direct and indirect (through relational energy) impact of inclusive leadership on workplace avoidance behaviors for neurodivergent employees. We also examine the moderating role of personal self-control demands in the relationship between relational energy and workplace avoidance. We tested our model using partial least square - structural equation modeling analysis with data collected using a time-lagged data collection in a sample of 215 neurodiverse employees working in multinational companies across the Gulf Cooperation Council region (i.e., Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Oman). The findings demonstrate that inclusive leaders mitigate workplace avoidance behavior in neurodivergent employees. That is, inclusive leaders create an environment that contributes to the cultivation of employees' personal relational energy resources. Then, high levels of relational energy interact with employees' level of personal demands (i.e., impulse control, resisting distractions) to reduce workplace avoidance behaviors. Our work speaks to the integrated role of demands and resources in workplaces that can thwart avoidance behaviors for neurodivergent employees.",art

Work passion-a motive that contains affective and cognitive components-is highly desirable and has positive consequences for individuals and organizations. We propose work passion as the missing piece that can explain unique variance in job satisfaction above and beyond the established predictor of dispositional affect. Taking a motivational approach based on the Dualistic Model of Passion and self-determination theory, we tested how two types of work passion (harmonious and obsessive) and two types of dispositional affect (positive and negative) predicted overall job satisfaction and nine job satisfaction facets (satisfaction with pay, promotion, supervision, fringe benefits, contingent rewards, operating conditions, coworkers, the nature of work, and communication). In a two-wave study of working adults, structural equation modeling and regression-based relative weights analysis showed that harmonious passion predicted the largest proportion of variance in job satisfaction overall and in all nine of its facets. Together, our findings highlight the importance of harmonious passion and the utility of a motivational theoretical perspective on job satisfaction for HR scholars and practitioners.",art

10.1002/hrm.22202,"Reactions to asynchronous video interviews: The role of design decisions and applicant age and gender. Asynchronous video interviews (AVIs) are a form of one-way, technology-mediated selection interview that can help streamline and increase flexibility in the hiring process and are used to hire millions of applicants per year. Although applicant reactions to AVIs in general tend to be more negative than with traditional interview modalities, AVIs can differ widely in how they are designed. For instance, applicants can be provided with more or less preparation time, response length, rerecording options, or rely on different question formats. This study examines how AVI design features impact applicant reactions, as well as the moderating role played by applicant age and gender. Data from 27,809 real job applicant's AVI experiences were collected in 11 countries (69.3% English-speaking) from 33 companies and relating to 72 types of positions. Data were fitted with linear mixed-effects models to account for nesting. Results showed that allowing more preparation time and offering the opportunity to rerecord responses were related to more favorable reactions, while including more questions was related to more negative reactions. Applicants above the age of 31 reacted especially negatively to AVIs with more questions while those below the age of 30 preferred being allocated longer maximum response lengths. Women reacted more positively to increased preparation time. These findings might help both AVI vendors and hiring organizations design AVIs that facilitate a positive applicant experience. Our research also expands knowledge on applicant reactions to interviews, highlights crucial differences from traditional formats, and calls for integrating applicant characteristics into current theoretical frameworks on applicant reactions to AVIs.",art
10.1002/hrm.22194,"Enacting people analytics: Exploring the direct and complementary effects of analytical and storytelling skills. Although research identifies analytical and storytelling skills as the two broad human capital inputs required to perform people analytics, further research is required to better understand how People Analysts that is, the enactors of people analytics, perceive the impact of these skills on their performance. Accordingly, this study draws on the human capital resource (HCR) and HCR complementarity frameworks to investigate the individual and collective impact of analytical and storytelling skills on People Analysts perceived job performance. A mixed-method sequential explanatory research design is adopted, finding mixed results. Consistent with existing research, results from Phase 1 find People Analysts perceive storytelling skills to be positively associated with their job performance. However, contrary to existing claims, the findings reveal that analytical skills are only perceived to be significant in influencing People Analysts job performance when combined with storytelling skills, supporting a complementarity HCR relationship. To further explain the findings from Phase 1, Phase 2 involved collecting data from 50 people analytics professionals via semi-structured interviews. Results from the thematic analysis reinforce the survey findings while also illustrating that People Analysts perceive the complementarity relationship between analytical and storytelling skills as important for improving job performance. Accordingly, we argue that debate in this area should be reframed to acknowledge the necessity of complementarities in building people analytics capabilities.",art
10.1002/hrm.22096,"A human capital-based framework of career, well-being, and social information reasons for managerial lateral job assignment preferences. Research on job assignments has generally assumed employees will accept assignments when offered. In this study, we examine managerial preferences for potential job assignment opportunities conceptualized using human capital theory to provide a holistic understanding of this phenomenon. Using two pilot studies, we refine the list of reasons managers use when forming lateral assignment preferences. In the main study, we collected data from a representative sample of more than 1200 managers in a large US organization who provided preferences for all possible assignment locations (about 40) in their regions and reported reasons for their preferences. Results showed career development reasons (e.g., promotion potential, opportunity to learn) and social information reasons (e.g., location manager, customers) attracted managers to assignments, and health and well-being reasons (e.g., commuting, stress) repelled managers. There were several differences in these relationships by managerial level such that health and well-being reasons were more important than career development reasons for lower-level managers than higher-level managers, who seemed to generate their preferences based more evenly on both types of reasons. We ask whether gender moderates the relationship between health and well-being reasons and preferences and find little support. We also explore whether manager racioethnicity moderates the relationship between community racioethnicity and preferences and find a few differences. Most findings were replicated when predicting actual movement 2 years later. Results suggest managerial preferences should consistently be considered in job assignment research and that organizations should obtain and use preference data when making internal staffing decisions.",art

PurposeThe importance of learning in development in increasingly dynamic contexts can help individuals and organizations adapt to disruption. Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a disruptive technology, with increasing adoption by various human resource management (HRM) functions. However, learning and development (L&D) adoption of AI is lagging, and there is a need to understand of this low adoption based on the internal/external contexts and organization types. Building on open system theory and adopting a technology-in-practice lens, the authors examine the various L&D approaches and the roles of human and technology agencies, enabled by differing structures, different types of organizations and the use of AI in L&D.Design/methodology/approachThrough a qualitative interview design, data were collected from 27 key stakeholders and L&D professionals of MSMEs, NGOs and MNEs organizations. The authors used Gioia's qualitative research approach for the thematic analysis of the collected data.FindingsThe authors argue that human and technology agencies develop organizational protocols and structures consistent with their internal/external contexts, resource availability and technology adoptions. While the reasons for lagging AI adoption in L&D were determined, the future potential of AI to support L&D also emerges. The authors theorize about the socialization of human and technology-mediated interactions to develop three emerging structures for L&D in organizations of various sizes, industries, sectors and internal/external contexts.Research limitations/implicationsThe study hinges on open system theory (OST) and technology-in-practice to demonstrate the interdependence and inseparability of human activity, technological advancement and capability, and structured contexts. The authors examine the reasons for lagging AI adoption in L&D and how agentic focus shifts contingent on the organization's internal/external contexts.Originality/valueWhile AI-HRM scholarship has primarily relied on psychological theories to examine impact and outcomes, the authors adopt the OST and technology in practice lens to explain how organizational contexts, resources and technology adoption may influence L&D. This study investigates the use of AI-based technology and its enabling factors for L&D, which has been under-researched.",art

Purpose - This paper aims to examine human resource management (HRM) in the gig economy through a moral economy lens and to uncover how sharing and firm ownership influences the (un)ethical use of HRM practices and worker treatment. Design/methodology/approach - Conceptual and empirical insights from contemporary HRM literature are synthesised through a systematic literature review to elucidate pressing challenges for research and practice. Findings - The analysis reveals that the different ownership structures used by gig firms shape the nature and degree of sharing. The gig economy built on investor ownership leads to greater sharing with investors and tends to be more exploitative of workers, whereas platforms built on collaborative ownership engage in greater peer-to-peer sharing which is more equitable and leads to higher quality work relations and HRM. Practical implications - The closer an organisation's alignment with the more equitable/relational end of the gig economy spectrum, the better the work relations and HRM. Originality/value - A new integrated conceptual spectrum of sharing in the gig economy is advanced, which aids in understanding evolving developments in HRM theory and practice.",art

Purpose The purpose of this study was to address calls for and test efficacy of an app based, short term resilience intervention for individual benefit. Design/methodology/approach Three independent samples of participants were assessed to determine the efficacy of an employee focused resilience intervention. Study 1 includes a cross sectional validation of the approach. Study 2 examines validity of the intervention using pre- and post-tests. Study 3 utilizes random assignment of groups (treatment and control) to determine invention results on resilience and individual psychological well-being. Findings Evidence suggests employees in the experimental group reported higher levels of resilience and psychological well-being as a result of the intervention. Further, the authors found no significant changes in resilience or psychological well-being amongst employees in the control group suggesting the intervention induced the effect. Originality/value Previous research attempting resilience interventions have been long, cumbersome and expensive for organizations.

Purpose This study examines the relationship between the flexibility of working from anywhere and employees' psychological well-being (PWB) and safety. This study also investigates the moderating role of human resource (HR) leadership teams on HR policy (HRP), firm infrastructure (FRI) and remote work flexibility. Design/methodology/approach With the help of the literature review and flexible firm theory (FFT) and dynamic capability view (DCV) theory, a model has been developed conceptually. Later, the conceptual model is validated using partial least squares - structural equation modelling technique considering 471 useable respondents from different Asian and European firms to understand cross-country implications. This research study uses convenience and purposeful sampling techniques. Findings This study shows that there is a significant and positive moderating role of HR leadership support (HLS) towards developing flexible HRP and appropriate FRI to enable employees to work from anywhere. The results also indicate that there is a significant and positive impact of work from anywhere flexibility (WAF) and employee PWB and psychological safety (PSS), which in turn positively and significantly impact employee satisfaction (EMS) resulting in better firm performance (FP). Research limitations/implications This study provides valuable input to HR management teams for developing effective HR policies to enable a work from anywhere option. The study also provides food for thought to practitioners, researchers and academicians regarding the need for more research on the relationship between work flexibility, PWB and FP. Finally, this study develops a unique model which could be used by any firm towards framing an effective HRP enabling WAF. Originality/value This research adds value to the overall body of knowledge of HR management. There is no study which investigated the impact of WAF on employee PWB and PSS. Thus, this study is considered a unique study. Moreover, the proposed model in this research study is also a unique model with explanative power of 71%.",art

Purpose This study examined the dynamical and positive effects of leader consultation on employee proactivity from a motivational perspective. Design/methodology/approach Survey data were collected twice a day from 107 employees in a week by using an experience sampling method. Findings On a daily basis, leader consultation had a positive effect on employees' state work engagement, which in turn promoted employees' proactivity. Moreover, authoritarian leadership weakened the positive relationship between leader consultation and employees' state work engagement.

10.1108/PR-03-2021-0151,"High-involvement work practices, employee trust and engagement: the mediating role of perceived organisational politics. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine perceptions of organisational politics (POP) as a mediator of the relationship between high-involvement work practices (HIWPs) and employee outcomes (trust in employer and employee engagement). Design/methodology/approach Using a longitudinal time-lagged quantitative survey design, data were collected in two waves (n = 1,554, time 1, and n = 970, time 2). Direct and indirect (mediation) effects were tested through structural equation modelling (SEM) in AMOS. Findings The results of SEM suggest that HIWPs are positively associated with trust in the employer and employee engagement and negatively associated with POP. The data supported a partial mediation model in which POP mediated the relationship between HIWPs and both trust in the employer and employee engagement levels. Practical implications HIWPs reduce employees' perceptions of the degree to which their work environment is politicised, enhance employee engagement and develop a more trusting relationship between employee and employer. Originality/value Perceptions that workplace environments are characterised by political behaviours are ubiquitous and a large body of research has highlighted their detrimental effects on both employees and employers. This is the first study that has examined the potential of HIWPs in reducing such perceptions, which in turn, can foster employee engagement and enhance trust in the employer. Longitudinal studies of the effect HIWPs have on employee perceptions and attitudes are also still scarce.",art
10.1108/PR-06-2019-0295,"Involved fathering: how new dads are redefining fatherhood. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate how professional men in dual-career relationships craft and enact their fatherhood role ideologies during the transition to fatherhood. In particular, the authors focus on the impact that the development of a more involved approach to fatherhood has on the mother's ability to combine career and family. Design/methodology/approach This study utilizes a longitudinal, qualitative methodology. Pre- and post-natal interviews were conducted with 18 professional men in dual-career heterosexual relationships. Findings Although the traditional mode of fatherhood that is rooted in breadwinning continues to be the dominant approach among working fathers in the US, new modes of more involved fathering are emerging. The results of the study indicate that a general shift away from a strict, gendered division of household labor is taking place in today's dual career couples, and this is leading to an increase in men's involvement in childcare. Further, although much of the extant research conceptualizes fatherhood as a role typology, the results reveal that all fathers are involved in caring for their babies, though to varying degrees. Thus the authors propose a continuum of involvement. Finally, the authors discovered how men are finding creative ways to use official and unofficial workplace flexibility to be more involved at home. Originality/value The findings offer novel insights into the factors that encourage involved fathering. The authors encourage organizations to create more supportive environments that foster involved fathering by extending paid parental leave benefits to men and providing more access to flexibility.",art

PurposeThis paper extends the institution theory to examine the relationship between high-performance work system (HPWS) and organizational performance (OP), and analyzes how country of origin interacts with performance measures and industrial affiliation in moderating the HPWS-OP relationship.Design/methodology/approachThe paper collects data of 60,142 firms and establishments in 252 studies published up to December 2021 and employs meta-analysis techniques to test hypotheses on the role of country of origin in moderating the HPWS-OP relationship in conjunction with performance measures and industrial affiliation.FindingsThe paper finds that, firstly, there is a positive relationship between HPWS and OP, but the relationship is much stronger in developing than advanced countries. Secondly, the relationship is stronger when OP is measured in operational than financial term in both developing and advanced countries, but the moderating effect of performance measures is stronger in developing than advanced countries. Thirdly, the relationship is stronger in service than manufacturing industries in developing countries, but no such variation is found in advanced countries.Originality/valueThe study for the first time unveils the important role of country of origin in interacting with performance measures and industry affiliation to condition the HPWS-OP relationship, and provides a coherent explanation based on institutional theory. The study sheds fresh light on the HPWS-OP relationship, and has important implications for managers.",art
10.1108/PR-06-2021-0430,"How human resource managers can prevent perceived pandemic threats from escalating into diminished change-oriented voluntarism. Purpose For human resource (HR) managers, the harmful outcomes of employees' ruminations about external crises, such as a pandemic, represent important, timely concerns. This research postulates that employees' perceptions of pandemic threats might diminish the extent to which they engage in change-oriented voluntarism at work. This negative connection may be attenuated by employees' access to two personal (work-related self-efficacy and organization-based self-esteem) and two relational (goal congruence and interpersonal harmony) resources. Design/methodology/approach The theoretical predictions are tested with survey data collected among employees who work in a banking organization in Portugal. Findings Persistent negative thoughts about a pandemic undermine discretionary efforts to alter and enhance the organizational status quo, but this detrimental effect is mitigated when employees (1) feel confident about their work-related abilities, (2) have a positive self-image about their organizational functioning, (3) share a common mindset with coworkers with respect to work goals and (4) maintain harmonious relationships with coworkers. Practical implications This study pinpoints several ways HR managers can reduce the danger that employees' worries about life-threatening crises may lead to complacent responses that, somewhat paradoxically, might undermine their ability to alleviate the suffered hardships. Originality/value The findings contribute to research on the impact of external crisis situations on organizations by providing an explanation of why employees may avoid productive, disruptive work activities, contingent on their access to complementary resources.",art
10.1108/PR-10-2020-0754,"Is meaningful work always a resource toward wellbeing? The effect of autonomy, security and multiple dimensions of subjective meaningful work on wellbeing. Purpose Using conservation of resources as a theoretical lens, the paper aims to investigate distinct objective meaningful work (OMW) and subjective meaningful work (SMW) domains as resources that contribute to wellbeing. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional questionnaire was conducted with 879 employees, measuring OMW resources (job security and autonomy), SMW using the well-validated multidimensional Comprehensive Meaningful Work Scale (CMWS) focusing on five dimensions (integrity with self, expressing full potential, unity with others, service to others and balancing tensions), and three wellbeing outcomes (positive affect, negative affect and job stress). The authors conducted structural equation modeling, mediation analysis with PROCESS macro including bootstrapping, and dominance analysis, to identify the core relationships between OMW and SMW dimensions and three wellbeing constructs. Findings OMW resources are largely beneficially related to SMW dimensions; both OMW and SMW resources are mostly beneficially related to wellbeing outcomes; and the overall associations of OMW with the three wellbeing constructs are partially mediated by SMW. The dominance analyses of SMW with wellbeing shows expressing full potential is the most important predictor of positive affect, and integrity with self is the most important (negatively related) predictor of negative affect and job stress. Practical implications Our research, in pulling apart the different dimensions of MW, shows that to enhance wellbeing, HR professionals should not just pay attention to practices that support self-transcendent MW but also those that support the self. When not balanced, MW can lead to a loss of wellbeing. Originality/value The findings highlight that (1) while the current MW literature places a lot of emphasis on SMW, OMW remains an important consideration, and (2) while the MW literature often focuses on self-transcendent meanings, such as making a difference, the self-oriented dimensions of SMW are more dominant toward wellbeing. This is valuable to employees, managers, and HR professionals considering how to improve MW and wellbeing.",art

Purpose This paper aims to examine the influence of perceived overqualification on innovative behaviour in the workplace. By integrating self-efficacy and human capital theories, this study proposes that perceived overqualification improves innovative behaviour directly and indirectly by boosting employee creative self-confidence. It further investigates the boundary conditions imposed by perceived psychological safety in this process. Design/methodology/approach The research utilises a quantitative research methodology through a two-wave survey of 335 employees and their 135 leaders. Moderated and mediated regression analyses were used to analyse the research data. Findings The results revealed that perceived overqualification promotes innovative behaviour at work directly and indirectly through its positive influence on creative self-confidence. The mediating effect of creative self-confidence in the relationship between perceived overqualification and innovative behaviour is moderated by perceived psychological safety at work, such that the relationship is stronger in a higher perceived psychological safety condition compared to when it is low. Research limitations/implications This study has theoretical and practical implications for personnel management. From a theoretical perspective, it integrates human capital and self-efficacy theories to explain a mechanism through which perceived overqualification will lead to innovative behaviour in the workplace. From a managerial perspective, it mitigates the stigma associated with an overqualified workforce by suggesting that perceived overqualification can be a source of innovation at work. Originality/value This is the first study that examines the creative self-confidence-based mechanism in the relationship between perceived overqualification and innovative behaviour at work. It also explores the moderating role of psychological safety in this relationship.",art

Purpose How to design jobs to support innovation is an issue that has received plenty of consideration over the past years. Building on the job characteristics model, the present study is set up to identify configurations of perceived job characteristics for innovation. Design/methodology/approach By adopting a fuzzy-set configurational approach (fsQCA), the research question is addressed through a two-wave self-report survey of 199 employees of an Italian manufacturing company. Findings Results reveal four compatible configurations of job characteristics leading to high levels of innovative work behavior and two for low levels. Practical implications The results offer guidance for managers and organizations that aim to strengthen employee-driven innovation by offering different recipes of job design to maximize the chance of boosting innovative behaviors among their workers. Originality/value This research is one of the first to empirically test the relation of job characteristics for innovative behavior using a configurational approach. By doing so it contributes to the literature by advancing the notion that innovative endeavors are determined by the holistic effects of different interdependent configurations of job characteristics.",art

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide a balanced and nuanced understanding of the relationship between high-performance work systems (HPWS) and employee thriving at work by aiming to consider the dark-side of HPWS and to uncover the black box. Design/methodology/approach This research draws from data from 377 employees nested in 77 work teams and tests a multilevel moderated mediation model using multilevel path analysis. Findings The findings indicate that employees appraise HPWS as both a challenge and a hindrance simultaneously. The challenge appraisal associated with HPWS positively influences employees' thriving at work whereas hindrance appraisal of HPWS negatively influences thriving experience. The results also support the hypothesized relationships in which servant leadership moderates the indirect effect of HPWS on employee thriving via challenge and hindrance appraisals accordingly. Originality/value This research demonstrates both positive and negative sides of HPWS as evaluated by employees in relation to an important employee outcome of thriving at work. It enriches the strategic HRM literature by identifying the black box of HPWS-employee outcomes and associated boundary condition from the theoretical perspective of cognitive appraisals.,art

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the perspectives of human resource professionals (HRPs) and employee representatives (ERs) on the role of HRPs in managing workplace bullying. Design/methodology/approach Individual interviews were conducted with 12 HRPs and five ERs from a wide range of industries. Interview questions were open-ended and sought to gain insight on the views of the individual interviewees. Findings The findings address the role of HRPs in bullying scenarios and in the prevention of bullying. Regarding the role of HRPs in bullying, the responses of the participants suggest confusion and ambiguity, with a variety of roles being described ranging from a support-based role through to a protector of management. The participants also noted the importance of the HRP task of policy development, while a distrust of HRPs in bullying scenarios was mentioned. Regarding the effective management and prevention of bullying, the findings demonstrate that HRPs are viewed as having a central role through their particular responsibilities of creating and nurturing a positive organisational culture, as well as through engaging employees in the development of anti-bullying policies. Practical implications HRPs believe that they can contribute significantly to reducing workplace bullying through organisational culture (including educating staff and as role models of behaviour) and by engaging staff in the design of anti-bullying policies. Originality/value This paper contributes to the literature on workplace bullying by examining within the Australian context the perspectives of HRPs and ERs on how HRPs can prevent and manage workplace bullying.",art

PurposeOnline employee reviews have emerged as a crucial information source for business managers to evaluate employee behavior and firm performance. The purpose of this paper is to test the relationship between employee personality traits, derived from online employee reviews and job satisfaction and turnover behavior at the individual level.Design/methodology/approachThe authors apply text-mining techniques to extract personality traits from online employee reviews on Indeed.com based on the Big Five theory. They also apply a machine learning classification algorithm to demonstrate that incorporating personality traits can significantly enhance employee turnover prediction accuracy.FindingsPersonality traits such as agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness are positively associated with job satisfaction, while extraversion and neuroticism are negatively related to job satisfaction. Moreover, the impact of personality traits on overall job satisfaction is stronger for former employees than for current employees. Personality traits are significantly linked to employee turnover behavior, with a one-unit increase in the neuroticism score raising the probability of an employee becoming a former employee by 0.6%.Practical implicationsThese findings have implications for firm managers looking to gain insights into employee online review behavior and improve firm performance.

PurposeThe aims of this critical review are to identify the mentor characteristics that lead to superior mentoring outcomes and to provide human resources development (HRD) professionals with evidence-based suggestions for recruiting, selecting and training mentors to improve mentorship programme effectiveness.Design/methodology/approachThe authors conducted a critical review of existing quantitative research on mentor characteristics that have an impact on effective mentoring.FindingsThe authors identified five key categories of mentor characteristics linked to successful mentoring outcomes: competency in context-relevant knowledge, skills and abilities; commitment and initiative; interpersonal skills; pro-social orientation and an orientation toward development, exploration and expansion.Research limitations/implicationsThere is limited research on the characteristics of ineffective mentor characteristics, exclusion of articles that used qualitative research methods exclusively and how technology-based communication in mentoring may require different characteristics. Most of the included studies collected data in the United States of America, which may exclude other important mentor characteristics from other non-Western perspectives.Practical implicationsTo ensure that there is both a sufficient pool of qualified mentors and mentors who meet the desired criteria, focus on both recruitment and training mentors is important. Incorporating the desired mentor characteristics into both of these processes, rather than just selection, will help with self-selection and development of these characteristics.Originality/valueDespite the ongoing interest in identifying effective mentor characteristics, the existing literature is fragmented, making this challenging for HRD professionals to determine which characteristics are crucial for mentoring relationships and programme success.

PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to unearth various dimensions of employee experience (EX) and explore how pandemic impacted various EX factors using online employee reviews. The authors identify employee-discussed EX-factors and quantify the associated sentiments and importance.Design/methodology/approachThis paper employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation on the online employee reviews to identify the key EX-factors. The authors probe sentiments and importance associated with key EX-factors using sentiment analysis, importance analysis, regression analysis and dominance analysis.FindingsThe result of topic modeling identifies 20 EX-factors that shape overall EX. While skill development plays a major role in shaping overall EX, employees perceived Salary and Growth as the most important EX-factor and expressed negative sentiments during the pandemic. Employee sentiments significantly influence overall EX.Practical implicationsWhen employees have extensive change experience, managers should consider various facets of EX to manage the smooth change and deliver a better EX. This research offers key EX-factors to be considered by managers while dealing with employees. Online employee reviews websites are recommended to include the identified key EX-factors to comprehend the holistic EX.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the growing literature on the employee experience as a concept by identifying various EX-factors. The authors expand the extant EX scales by identifying an inclusive and updated set of EX-factors.",art

Purpose The authors examine the interactive effects of work engagement and work autonomy in enhancing job crafting behaviour and performance. Design/methodology/approach Dyadic data from a sample of 320 white-collar employees in an Indian manufacturer are analysed through structural equation modelling. Findings The level of job crafting is highest when both work engagement and work autonomy are high. Job crafting fully mediates the interactive effect of work engagement and autonomy on task performance and partially on contextual performance. Practical implications There is value in reviewing organisational constraints on employee autonomy to foster the ways in which highly motivated workers can craft their jobs and, thus, maximise their performance. Originality/value This study demonstrates the interactive effects of work engagement and autonomy in enhancing job crafting and, through this mechanism, employee performance.",art
10.1108/PR-08-2020-0636,"The impact of COVID-19 on the work-life balance of working mothers: evidence from Nigerian academics. Purpose Given the limiting gender role conditions arising from the prevalence of patriarchy in Nigeria and the shift to workers staying at home due to the deadly spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), this article aims to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the work-life balance of professional mothers using the work-home resources model as a conceptual lens. Design/methodology/approach The qualitative data is based on telephone interviews with 28 married female university academics with children. Findings The findings reveal that the confinement policies enforced due to the need to combat the spread of COVID-19 and patriarchal norms deeply embedded in the Nigerian culture have exacerbated stress amongst women, who have needed to perform significantly more housework and childcare demands alongside working remotely than they did prior to the pandemic. The thematic analysis showed a loss of personal resources (e.g. time, energy, and income) resulting in career stagnation, health concerns, and increased male chauvinism due to the abrupt and drastic changes shaping the new normal lifestyle. Research limitations/implications The study relies on a limited qualitative sample size, which makes the generalisation of findings difficult. However, the study contributes to the emerging global discourse on the profound negative consequences of COVID-19 on the lives and livelihoods of millions, with a focus on the stress and work-family challenges confronting women in a society that is not particularly egalitarian - unlike Western cultures. Originality/value The article provides valuable insights on how the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected professional working mothers in the sub-Saharan African context, where literature is scarce.",art

Purpose The aim of the study is to extend prior research on career identity formation by investigating whether individuals' participation in informal workplace learning activities positively relates to career identity. The study also examines whether work engagement significantly mediates the participation in informal learning and career identity relationship. Design/methodology/approach Using data from a survey of 313 individuals in Iran, the study developed and tested measurement and structural models and employed partial least squares structural equation modelling to test the hypotheses. Findings The findings suggest that work engagement substantially mediates the positive relationship between participation in informal learning and career identity. Furthermore, the learning potential of the workplace and the propensities of individuals to actively approach situations that provide them with opportunities to learn and seek feedback on their performance have positive although varying relations with levels of participation in informal learning. Practical implications Human resource management and career management specialists must be cognisant of the central role that employee participation in informal learning plays in strengthening their work engagement and career identity. Learning and development specialists should seek to create conditions in the work environment that are favourable to informal learning and work engagement. Originality/value Although the role of formal development programmes in career identity formation is well documented, studies that examine links between participation in informal learning activities and career identity are very rare. Furthermore, there are no known studies that examine the potential mediating role of work engagement in the relationship between participation in informal learning activities and career identity.",art

Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of organizational goal ambiguity (OGA) on public service motivation (PSM) considering the mediating role of job satisfaction (JS), performance appraisal (PA) and perceived organizational fairness (POF) in the Iranian public sector. This research also seeks to answer this question: to what extent PSM confirmed in Western countries is generalizable to the Iranian public sector? Design/methodology/approach A survey of 779 employees working in 16 ministries of Iran was administered. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and hierarchical regression were applied to test the model and the mediators. Findings The results indicate that OGA negatively affects PSM, and this relationship is mediated by JS, PA and POF. Furthermore, the research findings have varied across ministries, contract type, positions and gender. Most importantly, the generalizability of the PSM construct is limited in the public sector of Iran since two of four dimensions of PSM were confirmed, that is, an attraction to public service and self-sacrifice (compassion). Practical implications This paper provides managers and decision makers with a clear understanding of the effects of context (including goal ambiguity, the importance of employee's attitudes and HR systems in shaping unique intrinsic motivation for public organizations) on employee's PSM. Also, these findings show how they can manage and motivate employees to engage in PSM. By clarifying organizational goals or making an association between job tasks and higher-level goals, practitioners can stimulate PSM at work. Originality/value This paper advances a new and further understanding of antecedent and mediators of PSM in Iran. Also, it provides an explanation of its generalizability and the role of organizational climate in fostering it.",art

Purpose Drawing on embeddedness theory, we examine how skilled immigrants' perceived brain-waste affects their social embeddedness. Social embeddedness facilitates the acquisition of host country-specific human capital, which, in return, can accelerate the transfer of immigrants' human capital in the workplace. Design/methodology/approach In total, 397 skilled immigrants in Australia participated in this study. We applied a set-theoretic approach to decode the complexity and interplay among the key concepts used in this study. Findings We found the impacts of psychological workplace wellbeing and workplace discrimination on social embeddedness differ between skilled immigrants who experience perceived brain-waste and skilled immigrants whose skills were recognized by employers. The results suggest that job satisfaction is the most critical factor contributing to social embeddedness among skilled immigrants who did not report brain-waste. Furthermore, we found that married skilled male immigrants who reported brain-waste still could embed socially if they did not directly experience workplace discrimination. Originality/value The majority of previous studies have compared skilled immigrants with their local-born colleagues, but we compared two groups of skilled migrants in the current study. We adopted fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to test how unique configurations of several variables can ease their social embeddedness into the host society.",art
10.1108/PR-05-2020-0313,"Linking performance pressure to employee work engagement: the moderating role of emotional stability. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the mediating role of threat and challenge appraisals in the relationship between performance pressure and employees' work engagement, as well as the buffering role of emotional stability, as a personal characteristic, in this process. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected using a three-wave research design. Hypotheses were examined with a sample of 247 white-collar employees from French organizations. Findings Performance pressure is appraised as either threat or challenge. Challenge appraisal positively mediated the performance pressure and work engagement relationship, whereas threat appraisal negatively mediated the performance pressure and work engagement relationship. Emotional stability moderated these effects, suggesting performance pressure was appraised as a challenge rather than a threat, which then enhanced employee work engagement. Practical implications This study has shown that employees with high emotional stability who perceived performance pressure as a challenge achieved stronger employee work engagement. Originality/value Building on Lazare's theory of stress and Mitchell et al. 's theorization, this research demonstrates mediating and moderating mechanisms driving the role of performance pressure on employee work engagement relationships.",art

Purpose This study contributes to the literature by explicating why individuals become effective in performing tasks in intercultural context. Drawing from the social axioms theory and intelligence theory, this study specifically investigates and generates new insights about the role of social complexity belief and cultural intelligence (CQ) in enhancing intercultural task performance. Design/methodology/approach Two sets of studies were conducted. Study 1 was conducted in Australia (n = 222) wherein survey data were collected from employees (i.e. self-reports). In a subsequent study which was conducted in the Philippines (Study 2; n = 211), archival data were obtained from the annual performance reviews of the employees (provided by immediate supervisors) in addition to the employees' self-reports. Findings Results are validated in both studies that social complexity belief relates positively and significantly to intercultural task performance. Moreover, results show that social complexity belief influences overall CQ (and its cognitive and metacognitive dimensions) and in the process impacts intercultural task performance. Originality/value This study offers new insights related to intercultural task performance effectiveness. In particular, this study highlights the role of social complexity belief system. Furthermore, this study extends the nomological network of CQ by explicating how an individual's belief can relate to his/her level of CQ which then influences intercultural task performance. Aside from generating knowledge, this study also offers practical insights for human resources practitioners and for employees who are finding new ways to improve and enhance intercultural task performance.",art
10.1002/hrm.22261,"A Strengths-Based Human Resource Management Approach to Neurodiversity: A Multi-Actor Qualitative Study. Although the attention for neurodiversity in human resource management (HRM) is growing, neurodivergent individuals are still primarily supported from a deficit-oriented paradigm, which points towards individuals' deviation from neurotypical norms. Following the HRM process model, our study explored to what extent a strengths-based HRM approach to the identification, use, and development of strengths of neurodivergent groups is intended, implemented, and perceived in organizations. Thirty participants were interviewed, including HRM professionals (n = 15), supervisors of neurodivergent employees (n = 4), and neurodivergent employees (n = 11). Our findings show that there is significant potential in embracing the strengths-based approach to promote neurodiversity-inclusion, for instance with the use of job crafting practices or (awareness) training to promote strengths use. Still, the acknowledgement of neurodivergent individuals' strengths in the workplace depends on the integration of the strengths-based approach into a supportive framework of HR practices related to strengths identification, use, and development. Here, particular attention should be dedicated to strengths development for neurodivergent employees (e.g., optimally balancing strengths use). By adopting the strengths-based HRM approach to neurodiversity as a means of challenging the ableist norms of organizations, we add to the HRM literature by contributing to the discussion on how both research and organizations can optimally support an increasingly diverse workforce by focusing on individual strengths.",art
10.1002/hrm.22205,"Context is key: A 34-country analysis investigating how similar HRM systems emerge from similar contexts. Using an institutional lens, we investigate the isomorphic effects of both external and internal contexts on human resource management (HRM) systems. Our analysis uses data from 4768 organizations across 34 countries to focus on the similarities in HRM systems. By employing distance matrices, a commonly adopted method in geographic science, we find that both external and internal contexts affect (dis)similarities in HRM systems. Organizations in similar environments exhibit more similar HRM systems. Furthermore, we find that the devolvement of HRM activities from HRM to line management reduces the similarity of HRM systems across organizations. By contrast, a strong strategic position of HRM does not yield a comparable effect. Our study's main contributions include elucidating the multifaceted relationship between context and HRM, highlighting the HRM department's role in this relationship, clarifying the context-HRM connection via the concept of isomorphic pressures, and illustrating the use of distance matrices as tool with great explanatory power for the analysis of similarities among HRM phenomena.",art
10.1002/hrm.22186,"Profiles of diversity and inclusion motivation: Toward an employee-centered understanding of why employees put effort into inclusion and exclusion. Despite their prevalence, workplace diversity and inclusion (D & I) practices continue to produce inconsistent effects on employee attitudes and behaviors. This shines a light on the need for evidence-based approaches in understanding how employees enact D & I goals. Drawing on self-determination theory, we argue that employee D & I motivation is an untapped pathway for understanding how inclusion-supportive employee outcomes (i.e., more inclusion and less exclusion) emerge. In addition, we leverage attribution theory to inform when employee motivation can be shaped, demonstrating that employee attributions of the intentions behind their organization's D & I practices play an important role in shaping their subsequent D & I motivation. Across two studies, latent profile analysis identified five distinct profiles of D & I motivation, which were differentially related to inclusion and exclusion (Study 1) and predicted by D & I attributions (Studies 1 and 2). Combined, these findings highlight the importance of understanding employee motivations and attributions within the context of D & I. Such knowledge can inform how employees enact inclusion goals, which has the potential to help organizations realize the desired benefits of diversity.",art
10.1002/hrm.22137,"A relational view of shiftwork: Co-scheduling with higher performers. Research in HR has devoted little attention to the practice of scheduling shift workers into times and places to conduct their work. Relying upon the growing literature related to relational HR, we propose a relational view of scheduling that focuses on how employees' social contexts-particularly their being co-scheduled with higher performers-relate to changes in performance over time. We apply resource dependence and social learning theories to describe how employees' performance over time depends upon their working alongside higher performers. Higher performers consume limited resources (thereby constraining peers' performance in the short term), yet also provide instructive role models for learning new skills (thereby elevating peers' performance over the longer term). We further hypothesize these effects are stronger for employees who are newer to the firm in contrast to those with more experience. We analyze scheduling and performance data from 7,893 retail sales representatives over a 1-year period. Results show co-scheduling with higher performers has an immediate negative effect on employee performance, but is positively related to employee performance over time. Unexpectedly, co-scheduling effects were present for all employees and not only for those new to the organization. Our study points to the need for HR research on employee scheduling to better understand how shift workers' schedules provide the relational context for their work. The research offers several theoretical contributions in understanding the peer effects of higher performers, and we offer practical implications for managers seeking to design employees' schedules to encourage organizationally advantageous relationships between coworkers.",art
10.1002/hrm.22134,"Does emotional restraint or exuberance get you the job? How and when enthusiasm intensity is related to perceived job suitability. Scholars have identified that interviewers prefer applicants who are both emotionally restrained and exuberant. To reconcile these inconsistent results, we investigated how the magnitude of applicants' expressed enthusiasm influences interviewer perceptions of job suitability. In two experimental studies with recruiters in China, we show that expressing intense as opposed to mild enthusiasm reduces applicants' chances to be perceived as suitable for the job (Study 1). We further demonstrate that expressions of intense enthusiasm do not always undermine their perceived job suitability but can also lead to a positive interview outcome. We find that the negative consequences of intense enthusiasm are explained by interviewer perceptions of decreased appropriateness, whereas the positive consequences are driven by interviewer perceptions of the applicant's attraction to the organization (PAAO; Study 2). We also report how interviewer trait information processing motivation (IPM) influences the way applicants expressing intense enthusiasm are evaluated. Only interviewers with low trait IPM interpret applicants' intense enthusiasm as less appropriate. We propose to incorporate the social signaling character of emotions in future theorizing and research on nonverbal communication in job interviews.",art
10.1002/hrm.22116,"Creative performance pressure as a double-edged sword for creativity: The role of appraisals and resources. Creativity, or the generation of novel and useful ideas or products, is widely viewed as the cornerstone of organizational innovation and success. However, high pressure to be creative may have mixed implications for employee creativity. In this article, we first systematically conceptualize the nature of the concept of creative performance pressure. Next, building on transactional stress theory, we investigate (a) how creative performance pressure influences employee creativity through different appraisals (i.e., challenge and hindrance) and (b) the moderating role of a job and personal resource (i.e., servant leadership and promotion focus) in the stressor appraisal process. In Study 1, we developed a creative performance pressure scale and assessed its psychometric properties across two samples (N = 181 for Sample 1; N = 253 for Sample 2). In addition, using multi-wave, multi-source data (Study 2), we tested our hypotheses in a Chinese sample (N = 206). The results demonstrated that creative performance pressure can have both positive and negative effects on employee creativity through challenge and hindrance appraisals, respectively. Servant leadership moderated the effect of creative performance pressure on challenge and hindrance appraisals, by transmitting the beneficial and detrimental effects of creative performance pressure to creativity, respectively. Similarly, promotion focus moderated the relationship between creative performance pressure and hindrance appraisal. We discuss future research directions and offer several practical implications for both organizational leaders and human resource (HR) practitioners.",art

While prior studies in human resource management have investigated how employee outcomes have been affected in high-risk workplaces, this study stands out by examining this issue through the role played by COVID-19 as a specific stressor. We explained how employees' perceived health risks due to COVID-19 (CV19PHR) and perceived workplace safety practices (PWSPs) affected job performance via burnout and how PWSPs moderated the CV19PHR-burnout and CV19PHR-JP relationships. We also examined how mindfulness moderated the direct effects of CV19PHR and PWSPs on burnout and JP and the indirect effects of CV19PHR and PWSPs on JP via burnout. We performed three studies using an explanatory sequential mixed-method design. In study 1, a three-phase survey with 987 respondents was conducted to test the hypotheses. In study 2, by analyzing verbatim from 22 informants, the findings of study 1 and some main points concerning mindfulness and PWSPs were explained. In study 3, using data from 12 informants, we investigated how COVID-19 affected individuals differently compared with other high-risk workplaces and whether the impact of COVID-19 on individuals was curvilinear. We demonstrated that employees' CV19PHR was positively correlated with burnout, negatively influencing JP. Moreover, PWSPs reduced burnout, which adversely affected JP. Interestingly, PWSPs positively moderated the CV19PHR-burnout relationship but not the CV19PHR-JP relationship. We also found that mindfulness moderated the CV19PHR-burnout and PWSPs-burnout relationships. Furthermore, mindfulness significantly moderated the mediating effects of burnout on the CV19PHR-JP and PWSPs-JP relationships.",art

Analyzing qualitative case-study data from two emerging market multinational corporations (MNCs) from the Indian pharmaceutical industry, we develop two theoretical frameworks based on goal-setting and cognitive evaluation theories along with indigenous Indian management theories, including the principles of Ayurveda for analyzing performance management systems in an indigenous and modern pharmaceutical MNC. Data were analyzed from multiple data sources, such as interviews, non-participant observation, multiple site visits, organizational documents, policies, client testimonials, and publically available information through the website and annual reports. The indigenous firm offered a holistic approach to managing multiple stakeholders. Its overarching performance goal focused on all stakeholders collectively contributing to the patient' and others' holistic well-being. All employees' and stakeholders' unified and singular efforts dovetailed to achieve physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, and environmental well-being as a proxy for performance. Organizational values, culture, and contextual influences of informal learning, empowerment, and task variability helped achieve its overarching goals.

PurposeThis study aims to investigate the effect of sandwich-generation caregiving (caregiving for elders and children simultaneously) on employed caregivers' job satisfaction when compared with non-sandwich caregiving patterns of no caregiving, children-only caregiving and elders-only caregiving. This study also aims to explore whether depression mediates this effect and whether three types of caregivers-friendly work time (less work-time length, less nonstandard work-time schedule and more work-time autonomy) buffer these direct and indirect effects.Design/methodology/approachA sample of 7,571 Chinese employees is chosen from the 2020 China Family Panel Studies through a multistage stratified sampling design.FindingsAfter controlling for employees' sociodemographic, work and other caregiving characteristics, this study finds that sandwich-generation caregiving is indeed more likely to negatively affect employees' job satisfaction when compared with no caregiving and elders-only caregiving, but to the same extent as children-only caregiving. This study also suggests that the effect of sandwich-generation caregiving on job satisfaction is mediated by employees' depression and that three types of caregiver-friendly work time help to weaken the negative effects on employees' depression and job satisfaction.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to explore the negative spillover effect and its mechanisms of caregiving on employees' job satisfaction through focusing on a special caregivers group: employed sandwich-generation caregivers.

PurposeResearch has suggested that employees interpret high-performance work systems (HPWSs) as targeting two distinct organizational objectives: enhancing performance and promoting employee well-being. These attributions often exert divergent effects on employee attitudes. Thus, this study aims to investigate this dynamic within the context of the Korean nursing occupation, clarifying how the HPWS can simultaneously evoke dual attributions: human resource (HR) well-being and HR performance attributions. Additionally, the authors examine the contrasting effects of these attributions and identify a moderating variable that could reconcile them. Drawing on the psychological experience of status theory, the authors conceptualize and test the moderating effect of employees' self-perceived status on the relationship between HR performance attribution and affective commitment.Design/methodology/approachData were collected from 475 nurses in 82 work units in Korean hospitals. Hypotheses were tested in a multilevel moderated mediation model.FindingsThe findings revealed that an HPWS elicits HR well-being and HR performance attributions. While HR well-being attribution was positively associated with affective commitment, HR performance attribution was positively related to affective commitment when employees' self-perceived status was high. Moreover, the HPWS demonstrated an indirect relationship with affective commitment via increasing HR performance attribution when self-perceived status was high.Originality/valueAlthough the personal meaning of HR attributions differs depending on the perceiver's situation, this aspect has received little attention in the field of research. This study advances the understanding of HR attributions derived from the HPWS within the specific context of Korean nursing. Furthermore, the authors suggest that the two attributions may not conflict with each other, indicating that the impact of HR performance attribution is conditional on an individual's self-perceived status.",art

Purpose- Integrating individual and relational centric voice literature, the authors draw on self-presentation theory to analyse the role of status pursuit in employee voice. Status pursuit is believed to be ubiquitous as it is linked to access to scarce resources and social order pecking.Design/methodology/approach- The authors present a cross-level conceptual model outlining relational nuances of employee status pursuit that drive upward voice.Findings- The model integrates status pursuit with peer- and leader-related facets, focusing on three targets of voice: immediate leader (supervisor), diagonal leader (supervisor of another team/unit) and co-workers. The model highlights how employee voice can be directed to diverse targets, and depending on interpersonal attributes, how it serves as underlying links for upward voice.Originality/value- While employee voice can help to address important workplace concerns, it can also be used to advance employees' self-interest.

Purpose The purpose of this study was to advance research on work-related well-being and age by using a life-span approach to investigate the relationship between mastery goal orientation and work engagement during various age periods. The authors further tested whether a perceived motivational climate moderated the proposed relationships, and whether the nature of the moderation differed between age groups. Design/methodology/approach The authors utilized a two-wave, web-based questionnaire survey and collected data from 838 employees in the financial sector in Norway. Multiple regressions and PROCESS macro were used to test these hypotheses. Findings The authors found that both work engagement and mastery goal orientation differed across age groups and that the relationship between mastery goal orientation and work engagement was stronger for older than for younger ages. The results further support the moderating role of a motivational climate. Whereas a perceived mastery climate moderated the relationship between mastery goal orientation and work engagement for older workers, a perceived performance climate moderated the suggested relationship for younger workers. Originality/value The study extends research on work engagement in an age-diverse workforce by applying a life-span approach to the interplay between person and contextual elements in fostering work engagement.

Purpose Based on the theoretical underpinnings of the theory of work adjustment and social exchange framework, the authors contend that an employee's trust in management (TIM) will interact with the flourishing-at-work (FAW) to predict turnover intentions (TIs). Specifically, the authors assumed that FAW will have a stronger negative effect on TIs, given the greater degree of TIM. Design/methodology/approach Leveraging a cross-sectional survey design and data gathered from 587 IT professionals working in India, the findings revealed that FAW negatively predicted TIs. More importantly, TIM accentuates or moderates the negative relationship between FAW and TIs. Findings Specifically, TIM was found to have a significant moderating effect on the relationship between (1) psychological well-being (PWB) and TIs, (2) social well-being and TIs. Interestingly, a nonsignificant moderating effect was observed on the relationship between emotional well-being (EWB) and TIs. Research limitations/implications The research findings of this study might be context-specific as the IT industry in India generally has high attrition, so obviously, a higher TIs is expected from IT professionals. Therefore, future studies should explore a different industry may be manufacturing and so on, to test the current study's research framework. Practical implications These are highly important contributions to the extant scholarship on FAW, as the study offers new wisdom into how FAW influences TIs under the contingent effect of TIM. Originality/value This is the first of its kind study to explore the moderating role of TIM on the link between FAW and employees' TIs.",art
10.1108/PR-08-2020-0658,"Employment expectations: examining the effect of psychological contract fulfillment on bridge employees' personal and work attitudes. Purpose In this study the authors examine whether bridge employees tend to hold non-standard jobs, and if so, whether non-standard job choice is deliberate. Moreover, the authors examine whether fulfillment of employment expectations affects the personal and work attitudes of bridge employees. Design/methodology/approach The authors' research and hypotheses are supported and developed through psychological contract theory. The authors collected data from 195 bridge employees, employed in a variety of jobs, through an online survey. Hypotheses were tested using hierarchical multiple regression. Findings This study suggests that some bridge employees may engage in non-standard employment deliberately. Moreover, we show that fulfillment of perceived obligation by employers (psychological contract) is associated with personal and work attitudes (life satisfaction, job satisfaction, affective commitment, normative commitment and intentions to stay) of bridge employees. Research limitations/implications While this study supports psychological contract theory as an important framework for understanding bridge employment, sample size, cross-sectional data and a lack of diversity in the sample limit causality, generalizability and data robustness. Future research should strive to replicate and extend the current findings. Practical implications The present study underlines the importance of designing jobs to meet the expectations of bridge employees. Also, it highlights the preference of bridge employees to engage in non-standard employment. Originality/value The authors extend bridge employment research by empirically examining the relationship between unmet employment expectations and the personal and work attitudes of bridge employees.",art

Purpose The aim of this study was to analyse the link between the values that govern the functioning of cooperatives and their sustainability. Furthermore, the authors propose that this relationship is mediated by AMO (ability, motivation and opportunity) practices, which generate different behaviours and attitudes in their employees, thus strengthening the message of sustainable management that the directors of this kind of companies aim to transmit. Design/methodology/approach This article presents a theoretical and empirical research model about the relationship between organisational values, AMO practices and sustainability in social economy firms. The proposed model was tested using the multivariate method of partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) with a sample of 124 cooperative companies. The information was gathered through a questionnaire with questions composed of measurement scales that had been previously validated by the reference literature. Findings This work empirically demonstrates that the perceived support, respect and responsibility values are strongly related to sustainability, and that ability and opportunity-enhancing practices mediate the association of perceived support and responsibility with the sustainability of cooperatives. Originality/value This work contributes to covering the lack of studies about which values support and impact the sustainability of organisations, and it provides information about the mediating role of certain AMO practices in the search for a more sustainable organisation, demonstrating that some practices are more relevant than others.",art
10.1108/PR-01-2021-0042,"I'm difficult, but not impossible: how millennials view international assignments and the implications for human resource management (HRM). Purpose The purpose of this study is to identify what (de)motivates millennial students from undertaking mobility upon graduation and whether this depends on gender, region of origin, prior work experience, level of studies, or international mindset and how. The paper provides insights on the preferred length of mobility and the most (un)attractive regions. Design/methodology/approach The sample consists of 1,001 millennial students from 77 countries. Data from a quantitative self-reported survey were analysed employing exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory data analyses. Findings Factors that motivate mobility are personal development, learning about foreign cultures and the opportunity to travel and those that demotivate are a preference for short-term assignments, unwillingness of family to move and disruption of home country life. Factors differ by region, gender, level of current studies and the student's international mindset. Research limitations/implications The cohort included only students pursuing a business or technical education. A willingness to accept an international assignment may not necessarily translate into accepting an international assignment due to the effect of the attitude-behaviour gap. The authors do not aim to generalise on the basis of the results since the sample was fairly disproportionate in terms of world regions. We do, however, invite further studies to treat ours as potential input for new and emerging studies of either a quantitative or qualitative nature. Practical implications Due to a strong attachment to home, short-term assignments are preferred. Salary and financial benefits remain hygienic factors and motivating factors remain on the soft side. Motivating millennials to engage in mobility requires an individualised approach, dependent on region of origin, gender, the level of education, work experience and international mindset. Originality/value This study indicates that the factors that (de)motivate millennial students to engage in international assignments differ on the basis of various socio-demographic variables.",art
10.1108/PR-07-2019-0375,"Board busyness and firm productivity. Purpose Prior studies provide mixed evidence on the association of board busyness and firm productivity. Thus, this paper empirically analyzes how board busyness affects firm productivity. Design/methodology/approach To measure board busyness, this paper computes the percentage of directors on a board who sit on three or more boards. Furthermore, to calculate firm productivity, the paper employs data envelopment analysis. Findings Findings demonstrate that the association of board busyness and firm productivity (association) is generally negative and statistically significant but economically insignificant. In this respect, the findings reveal that the association is negative (positive) and both statistically and economically significant for firms having higher monitoring (advising) needs. Moreover, the findings demonstrate that regulatory oversight (1) weakens the general negative association; (2) changes the direction of association from negative to positive, for firms having higher monitoring needs; and (3) does not influence the association, for firms having higher advising needs. Originality/value Taken together, the findings indicate that the association of board busyness and firm productivity is conditional to monitoring/advising needs and regulatory oversight. As such, the findings enrich the current debates on the association. Furthermore, the findings offer novel perspectives to enrich the regulatory frameworks of countries which are constraining multiple directorships.",art

Purpose This study draws upon the theory of eudaimonic motivation to develop a model that explains job performance in high-tech industry. This study aims to clarify through what mediating mechanism employees' social interaction and self-efficacy can substantially influence their job performance. At the same time, competence enhancement is examined as a moderator that influences the effects of social interaction and self-efficacy. Design/methodology/approach The hypotheses developed in this study were empirically tested by collecting three-source data from a leading international business company in Taiwan's high-tech industry. The survey data of this study were first analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis and hierarchical regression analysis for testing the hypotheses of the study. Post hoc tests were then performed using structural equation modeling and bootstrapping analysis for the purpose of double verifications. Findings This study finds that social interaction and self-efficacy relate to job performance via the full mediation of occupational commitment and achievement striving. Besides, the relationship between social interaction and occupational commitment is positively moderated by competence enhancement, while the relationship between self-efficacy and occupational commitment is negatively moderated by competence enhancement. Originality/value This work shows important findings that complement previous research on personnel performance and competence. First, this work confirms that social interaction and self-efficacy play critical roles for indirectly influencing job performance through the full mediation of occupational commitment and achievement striving among engineers in high-tech industry. Second, the moderating effects of competence enhancement on the relationships between social interaction and occupational commitment and between self-efficacy and occupational commitment are confirmed by this study.",art

Purpose Based on the conservation of resources view, the objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between abusive supervision and workplace thriving. Further, this study investigates the underlying mechanisms role of agentic work behaviors (i.e. task focus, heedful relating) and moderating role of employee's core self-evaluations. Design/methodology/approach Using a time-lag approach, data are collected from 360 full-time employees enrolled in an executive development program in a large university of China. To test the proposed model, data analysis is carried out through Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) and Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS). Findings The results show that abusive supervision negatively influences workplace thriving. Further, the findings also confirm the mediating role of agentic work behaviors and the moderating role of core self-evaluations between the relationship of abusive supervision and thriving. Practical implications Based on study findings, this study draws the attention of managers toward the new deleterious outcomes of abusive supervision. Hence, to nurture a thriving workforce, organizations should keep abusive behaviors under keen observations to minimize their frequent occurrences. Further, it is proposed that hiring employees with higher core self-evaluations can mitigate the injurious effect of abusive supervision. Originality/value This is the first attempt to our knowledge to untapped the abusive supervision-thriving relationship via the underlying mechanisms of two agentic work behavior's and core self-evaluations as a moderator enriches the extant body of knowledge and provide valuable insight into the abusive supervision and workplace thriving literature.",art

10.1002/hrm.22168,"Algorithmic HRM control in the gig economy: The app-worker perspective. Work in the gig economy is championed by platform organizations as affording individuals the flexibility to decide when, where, and how much they wish to work. The reality is more complex. In app-based gig work, we propose the concept of algorithmic HRM control, which acts as an omnipresent and distinctive control system that differs from traditional forms of control in two significant ways: first, the reliance upon, and pervasiveness of, algorithmic technologies in its enactment; and second, the substantial direct and indirect influence of non-organizational parties in controlling workers. Through a qualitative research design, this article delineates the scope of algorithmic HRM control in allocating and coordinating tasks, managing performance and rewards, and aligning the actions of workers with organizational objectives. Our analysis also unpacks the rigidity and complexities of the control system, as experienced by workers, and the influential role of non-organizational parties in exerting unique, distinct forms of control. In so doing, we build upon emerging research on the duality of algorithmic HRM by revealing the inherent flaws or challenges from the perspective of the most central party-the gig worker. While output-oriented control is pervasive, process and normative control elements are also found to exist in some scenarios, creating significant concerns for workers.",art

10.1002/hrm.22104,"Team boundary work and team workload demands: Their interactive effect on team vigor and team effectiveness. Drawing from team-level job demands-resources theory, we hypothesize that team workload demands moderate the positive link between team boundary work (i.e., boundary spanning and boundary buffering) and team effectiveness (i.e., team innovation and team performance), such that boundary work is more beneficial for team effectiveness when teams face higher team workload demands. Furthermore, we predict that this interaction occurs through increased team vigor, where team vigor is defined as an affective emergent state characterized by positive valences and high activation levels experienced by team members. We largely find support for our model across two field studies: a cross-sectional survey using three independent data sources (89 automotive research and development teams, including 724 team members, 89 team leaders and 18 managers) and a time-lagged survey using two independent data sources (139 teams working in a Chinese utility company, including 640 team members and 139 team leaders).

10.1002/hrm.22081,"Assessing job crafting competencies to predict tradeoffs between competing outcomes. We introduce the job crafting competency construct and apply it to predict tradeoffs between competing outcomes that are inherent in job crafting, like performance and well-being or engagement and withdrawal. Job crafting competencies are the clusters of individual knowledge, skills, and abilities that are necessary to achieve personal objectives through effective job crafting problem-solving. We create a framework of job crafting competencies consisting of comprehensive/simplistic heuristic information use and approach/avoidance problem-solving skills. In Study 1, we operationalize competencies as profiles demonstrated through an aptitude-oriented assessment that predicts differences in outcomes. Five distinct profiles emerged in a sample of 174 workers. The high-volume analytic problem-solving profile was associated with higher performance and strain, while the ambivalent acquiescence profile was associated with lower performance and strain. The practical problem-solving profile minimized tradeoffs between performance and strain. Rapid problem-solving and low-volume analytic problem-solving profiles were variants in between these other patterns. Study 2 used a survey of 323 workers to support the uniqueness of the five competencies, and their relationships with approach/avoidance job crafting, engagement, and withdrawal. The research identifies a new job crafting individual difference (job crafting competencies) to delineate outcomes and tradeoffs according to unique competency profiles.",art

Despite two decades of evolution as an area of research and practice, talent management faces ongoing criticism for being overly static in its approach, offering little in terms of enabling strategic agility. This is problematic as organizations increasingly rely on strategic agility to manage their dynamic business operations. Drawing on matching theory and adopting an agility lens, we explore the link between talent management and strategic agility. Through a qualitative research design, encompassing 34 interviews in 15 organizations, we explicate a skills-matching perspective on talent management, including initial and dynamic skills-matching in external and internal labor markets. Through this process, organizations can build a set of dynamic capabilities, underlying two meta-capabilities, strategic sensitivity and resource fluidity, which enable strategic agility. In doing so, we portray skills-matching as an illustration of a processual view on talent management and create a model of developing strategic agility through skills-matching, responsive to external and internal demands.",art
10.1002/hrm.22148,"Toward a more sustainable environment: Understanding why and when green training promotes employees' eco-friendly behaviors outside of work. Although green training has been shown in past research to promote environmentally responsible behaviors at work, scholars have paid less attention to its influence on employees' eco-friendly behaviors outside of work. This omission is critical because confining green training research to the work domain obscures its benefits in promoting employees' pro-environmental behaviors beyond the workplace, and thus its role in supporting organizational efforts to conserve the natural environment. To address this gap, we examine the direct and indirect (via connectedness to nature) relationships between green training and employees' eco-friendly behaviors outside of work, including consumption of eco-friendly products, reuse of items and materials, and reduced consumption of resources such as water, electricity, and paper. We also examine the moderating influence of intrinsic spirituality on the direct link between green training and connectedness to nature, as well as the indirect link between green training and eco-friendly behaviors beyond the workplace. Using time-lagged, multisource data, we find support for our hypotheses. Our findings advance knowledge on the important yet largely overlooked role of green training in shaping employees' environmentally responsible behaviors outside of the workplace.",art

Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to enrich the HRM literature on freelancers' work-life balance. To do so, we investigate the difference in freelance and employed journalists' work-life balance and the moderating role of work-scheduling autonomy, job-income security and collegial informational support, drawing on a theory novel to the HRM literature, that is, the Stress of Higher Status Theory. Design/methodology/approach-Data were collected with a survey questionnaire that was administered to a sample of 1,166journalists,including118 freelancers, in Norway in 2021.We analysed this data using a stepwise regression analysis. Findings-We report three main findings: First, we find evidence indicating that freelance journalists have less work-life balance than employed journalists. Second, our results provide support for the Stress of Higher Status Theory and testify to the relevance this theory has for high-skill workers. Third, only collegial support significantly(positively)moderates freelancers' work-life balance.

Purpose - The metaverse, through artificial intelligence (AI) systems and capabilities, allows considerable data analysis in the workplace, largely exceeding traditional people analytics data collection. While concerns over surveillance and issues associated with privacy and discrimination have been raised, the metaverse has the potential to offer opportunities associated with fairer assessment of employee performance and enhancement of the employee experience, especially with respect to gender and race, inclusiveness and workplace equity. This paper aims at shedding light on the diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) opportunities and challenges of implementing the metaverse in the workplace, and the role played by AI. Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on our past research on AI and the metaverse and provides insights addressed to human resources (HR) scholars and practitioners. Findings - Our analysis of AI applications to the metaverse in the workplace sheds light on the ambivalent role of and potential trade-offs that may arise with this emerging technology. If used responsibly, the metaverse can enable positive changes concerning the future of work, which can promote DEI. Yet, the same technology can lead to negative DEI outcomes if implementations occur quickly, unsupervised and with a sole focus on efficiencies and productivity (i.e. collecting metrics, models etc.). Practical implications - Managers and HR leaders should try to be first movers rather than followers when deciding if (or, better, when) to implement metaverse capabilities in their organizations. But how the metaverse is implemented will be strategic. This involves choices concerning the degree of invasive/pervasive monitoring (internal) as well as make or buy decisions concerning outsourcing AI capabilities. Originality/value - Our paper is one among few (to date) that discusses AI capabilities in the metaverse at the intersection of the HR and information systems(IS) literature and that specifically tackles DEI issues. Also, we take a balanced approach when evaluating the metaverse from a DEI perspective. While most studies either demonize or celebrate these technologies from an ethical and DEI standpoint, we aim to highlight challenges and opportunities, with the goal to guide scholars and practitioners towards a responsible use of the metaverse in organizations.",art

(2010) examined the expectations of young people in post-secondary education in 2007; those colloquially referred to as Millennials or GenY. The present study replicates Ng et al.'s (2010) study among a sample of post-secondary students in 2019 (referred to as Generation Z or GenZ) and compares the expectations of young adults in GenY and GenZ.Design/methodology/approachThis study employs a time-lag comparison of GenY and GenZ young career entrants based on data collected in 2007 (n = 23,413) and 2019 (n = 16,146).FindingsToday's youth seem to have realistic expectations for their first jobs and the analyses suggest that young people continue to seek positive, healthy work environments which make room for work-life balance. Further, young people today are prioritizing job security and are not necessarily mobile due to preference, restlessness or disloyalty, but rather leave employers that are not meeting their current needs or expectations.Practical implicationsUnderstanding the career expectations of young people allows educators, employers and policymakers to provide vocational guidance that aligns those expectations with the realities of the labor market and the contemporary career context.Originality/valueWhile GenY was characterized as optimistic with great expectations, GenZ can be described as cautious and pragmatic.

Design/methodology/approach The data for the study is collected from 219 top and middle-level managers and analyzed through partial least squares path structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings Findings indicate that job and career satisfaction have a significant and negative impact on personal attitude toward career change and subjective norms, whereas all three constructs of the TPB influence the intention to change career. In addition, the mediation of personal attitude and subjective norm pathways were found to be significant for both job and career satisfaction and career change intention relationships, while no mediation effect was identified for the perceived behavior control construct of the TPB. Research limitations/implications The results suggest important theoretical and practical implications. First, a novel model of mediation between job and career satisfaction and the intention to turn away from an existing career is introduced between job and career satisfaction and career change intention associations for testing the full TPB framework. Practical implications The findings imply that the impact of cognitive factors, including having a positive opinion about the potential outcomes of switching to a new career, the level of pressure exerted by significant third parties about making a career change, and the self-belief about making this change happen should be closely investigated when examining the determinants of career change intention.

Purpose The aim of this research is to determine the extent to which the human resource (HR) function can screen and potentially predict suicidal employees and offer preventative mental health assistance. Design/methodology/approach Drawing from the 2019 National Survey of Drug Use and Health (N = 56,136), this paper employs multivariate binary logistic regression to model the work-related predictors of suicidal ideation, planning and attempts. Findings The results indicate that known periods of joblessness, the total number of sick days and absenteeism over the last 12 months are significantly associated with various suicidal outcomes while controlling for key psychosocial correlates. The results also indicate that employee assistance programs are associated with a significantly reduced likelihood of suicidal ideation. These findings are consistent with conservation of resources theory. Research limitations/implications This research demonstrates preliminarily that the HR function can unobtrusively detect employee mental health crises by collecting data on key predictors. Originality/value In the era of COVID-19, employers have a duty of care to safeguard employee mental health.

Purpose With a focus on millennial employees, this study investigates how employees engage in two types of employees' communicative behaviors (ECBs), that is, their voluntary communicative efforts to acquire and circulate tasks and managerial information (i.e. scouting) and to share and discuss positive and negative aspects of their organization with internal members (i.e. internal megaphoning). Through the lens of social exchange theory (SET) and symmetrical communication model, this study examines the effects of inclusive leadership and internal communication on active information behaviors of employees within their companies. Design/methodology/approach An online survey was conducted with fulltime millennial employees working across various industry sectors in the US. Findings Symmetrical internal communication influenced by inclusive leadership enhances employees' scouting behavior as well as positive internal megaphoning behavior. Positive and negative internal megaphoning with supervisors increases the scouting behavior of employees, whereas negative internal megaphoning with peers does not have a significant effect.

Purpose This study aims to advance practice and research on workforce nationalization in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries through identifying relevant policy and practical implications needed to implement nationalization initiatives effectively. Design/methodology/approach The author followed a two-stage approach. Stage 1 reviewed the literature to identify relevant papers on workforce nationalization in the GCC region. Stage 2 used a thematic analysis to propose relevant implications for both policy makers and employers. Findings Through the lens of four perspectives at different levels, i.e. legal, organizational, human development and socio-cultural perspectives, the author has identified ten policy and practical implications. Both governments and employers need to consider these when developing holistic strategies for effective workforce nationalization. Originality/value Over several decades, the GCC countries have been implementing several nationalization initiatives to increase the percentage and qualifications of their national employees. The significance of these initiatives stems from the fact that the GCC countries lack adequately trained citizens. Moreover, regardless of political attitudes toward foreigners, development plans for modernization, industrialization or urbanization heavily relies on foreign employees. This is because nationals represent the minority of employees and are largely employed in the public sector. This phenomenon needs the attention of scholars to discuss different aspects of nationalization and how to effectively implement it.",art
10.1108/PR-09-2023-0783,"Beyond performance and potential in talent management: exploring the impact of mobility on talent designation. Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to contribute to a grounded understanding of how mobility impacts talent designation and with what consequences. Design/methodology/approach - An exploratory qualitative case study was conducted of a global medical technology corporation, based on interviews with HR managers, line managers and non-managerial employees. Findings - The findings illustrate that mobility plays a significant role in how employees are assigned talent status, and that mobility manifests and impacts talent designation through two types - geographical and lateral mobility. Mobility is not determined based on abilities and competencies, but rather on an employee's overall personal situation, including age, family status and relationship status. Two main practices emerged through which these determinants were decided: direct questioning and guesswork. The consequences that follow are that individuals are left with little room to influence their own talent situation, and that there is a risk of discriminatory and exclusionary consequences arising. Originality/value - The study makes two main contributions. First, it provides a more nuanced understanding of how talent designation unfolds in practice, showing that performance and potential alone cannot explain the process and emphasizing the consequential role of mobility. Second, it contributes with knowledge about the consequences of basing talent designation heavily on mobility. Individual employees are left with significantly less room for enacting agency and playing active roles in relation to TM than has been suggested. Added to this are the potential discriminatory and exclusionary consequences.",art

Purpose - Although many organisations and governments internationally acknowledge that a diverse workforce is essential for improved decision-making, employee well-being and organisational performance and competitiveness, women with disabilities and their (potential) participation and contributions within organisations continue to be overlooked and under-researched. Examining the careers of women with disabilities through the lens of human resource management (HRM) allows for the development of policies and practices that support their inclusion and progression in the workforce and helps lay the foundation for legislative, institutional and organisational changes that address the unique challenges faced by this cohort. Design/methodology/approach - We conducted a comprehensive, systematic scoping review that analyses various career-related aspects for women with disabilities across different cultural and geographical contexts internationally. A two-stage review (Stage 1 - Title and abstract screening and Stage 2 - Full-text review) of the extant literature on the careers of women with disabilities yielded 80 relevant empirical articles. Findings - Our review identified four key career-related themes pertaining to women with disabilities: (1) Educational interventions and support for positive career outcomes of women with disabilities; (2) Workplace discrimination and workplace accessibility of women with disabilities; (3) Factors influencing the career development and advancement of women with disabilities and (4) The role of gender in the career exploration and decision-making processes of women with disabilities.

10.1108/PR-03-2021-0138,"Full of energy - The relationship between supervisor developmental feedback and task performance: a conservation of resources perspective. Purpose Meaningful feedback at work signals effective performance management. Drawing on a new perspective of the conservation of resources (COR) theory, this paper aims to examine the mediating effect of relational energy in the relationship between supervisor developmental feedback and subordinates' task performance with the moderating role of learning demands. Design/methodology/approach Data from 230 supervisor-subordinate dyads were collected at two time points of four enterprises in China. Findings The results support the proposed mediation effect that supervisor developmental feedback positively predicts subordinates' task performance via boosting subordinates' relational energy. Furthermore, the results highlighted the moderating role of learning demands in the relationship between supervisor developmental feedback and subordinates' relational energy. The moderated-mediated relationship for subordinates' task performance was also supported. Originality/value Drawing on COR theory, this paper contributes to a complete understanding of how supervisor developmental feedback may support or build employees' relational energy, facilitating task performance and further exploring learning demands as a boundary condition of this indirect relationship.",art
10.1108/PR-07-2021-0492,"Reframing the performance management system: a conversations perspective. Purpose To explore human resource (HR) practitioner perspectives of the effectiveness, challenges, and aspirations of the performance management (PM) system to inform future directions for PM design and success. Design/methodology/approach Interviews with 53 HR practitioners from a cross-section of organisations operating in the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand. Findings Practitioner's discussed the criticality of effective conversations across all elements of the PM system. Using an interpretive approach, and through a lens of social exchange theory (SET), we used their voice to develop a conversations-based PM model. This model centres on effective performance conversations through the design and implementation of the PM system. It includes four enablers and five environmental elements. The enablers (aligned goals, frequent feedback, skills development, and formality) depend on skilled interactions and conversations, and the organisational environmental elements (design, development function, buy-in, culture, and linkage to other systems) are enhanced when effective conversations take place. Practical implications Practitioners can use the conversations model to help shape the way they design and implement PM systems, that place emphasis on upskilling participants to engage in both formal and informal honest conversations to build competency in the enablers and assess organisational readiness in terms of the environmental elements. Originality/value By listening to the under-utilised voice of the HR practitioner, and through a lens of SET, we developed a PM model which emphasises reciprocity and relationship building as key tenets of the PM system. While past research recognises the importance of effective conversations for PM implementation, it has largely silent been about the role of conversations in system design. Our model centres these conversations, presenting enablers and environmental elements to facilitate their core position within effective PM.",art

Purpose Self-service technologies (SST) have become more and more pervasive in retail to facilitate autonomous checkout. In this context, customers play an active role and, as such, can be considered as partial employees. Partial employees have to perform a wide range of tasks, get rewarded for their work and need to understand the terms of the exchange, all without being subject to a formalized contract. In this research, the authors suggest that partial employees go through a process of organizational socialization that allows them to define the psychological contract they hold with the organization. Design/methodology/approach In order to investigate the psychological contracts of partial employees, 324 Canadian customers using SST completed an online questionnaire, in which their SST use, psychological contract fulfillment and organizational socialization were measured. Findings Descriptive analyses highlight that customers as partial employees build a psychological contract with their most frequent retailer, as they perceive not only retailer inducements but also their own contributions. Multiple linear regressions suggest that organizational socialization favors psychological contract fulfillment, but that specific dimensions of organizational socialization are important for employer inducements vs. employee contributions. Moreover, results suggest that the frequency of use of SST as well as the patronage positively predicts psychological contract fulfillment. Originality/value This research investigates a specific situation of unconventional employment - that of customers as partial employees with organizations. It contributes to the literature on the psychological contract by broadening its application to new relations and to the literature on customer management by reemphasizing the relevance of the psychological contract in this domain.",art

Purpose This article identifies the contextual demands impacting the work from home (WFH) experience during the COVID-19 pandemic and considers their respective impact on employees' personal and work-related outcomes. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on a qualitative methodology, the authors thematically analyzed written narratives from 41 employees who had been required to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings Data analysis identified four layers of contextual demands (omnibus, task, social and personal) that had resulted in participants being required to work from home. Drawing on this finding, the authors develop a conceptual process model to extend current theory and explain how the respective demands impact individual affective reactions and work-related experiences, health and wellbeing. The authors' findings offer new insights into contexts where WFH becomes mandatory, indicating that it is characterized by a range of challenges and opportunities. Practical implications This paper signals the need to provide employees with a realistic preview of working from home demands, including interventions to better prepare them to navigate the daily stressors of working from home; and provision of virtual employee assistance programs in the form of online counseling. Originality/value This paper explores a unique phenomenon - the mandatory requirement to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on employees' personal and work-related experiences and outcomes.",art

Purpose This study aims to explore the relative importance of the subdimensions of total rewards satisfaction in predicting research and development (R&D) employee creativity. In addition, the study examines the indirect effects of the subdimensions of total rewards satisfaction on creativity via work engagement and the moderating role of challenge-related work stress in the first stage. Design/methodology/approach A two-wave design was used, in which total rewards satisfaction and challenge-related work stress were measured in the first wave. Work engagement and creativity were measured in the second wave. Dominance analysis and the latent moderated mediation model were used for the data analyses. Findings The analyses show that nonfinancial rewards satisfaction completely dominates indirect and direct financial rewards satisfaction when predicting creativity. Indirect financial rewards satisfaction completely dominates direct financial rewards satisfaction when predicting creativity. Work engagement mediates the relationships between the subdimensions of total rewards satisfaction and creativity. Challenge-related work stress moderates the relationships between the subdimensions of total rewards satisfaction and work engagement and the indirect effects of the subdimensions of total rewards satisfaction on creativity via work engagement. Practical implications The results imply that managers should set challenge demands for R&D employees and try to improve their total rewards satisfaction, especially their nonfinancial and indirect financial rewards satisfaction, for them to be more creative. Originality/value This empirical study contributes to the literature by comparing the relative importance of the different dimensions of total rewards satisfaction in predicting creativity. The study also clarifies how (through work engagement) and when (based on challenge-related work stress) the subdimensions of total rewards satisfaction are positively related to R&D employees' creativity.",art

Purpose This paper aims to investigate the impact of employee silence on performance and turnover intentions. In addition, it seeks to explore the mediating role of burnout in the link between employee silence, and three employee outcomes-supervisor-rated task/contextual performance and self-reported turnover intentions. Design/methodology/approach Using survey questionnaire design, this paper collected data from 508 telecom engineers and their immediate supervisors and analyzed the result using structural equation modeling (SEM) technique, bootstrapping. Findings Results reveal that employee silence leads to burnout which results in debilitating employee performance, increase in withdrawal behaviors and turnover intentions; burnout mediates these direct relationships. The findings have implications for organizational behavior (OB) research. Moreover, the study found that silence has more pronounced negative effect on employee performance and positive impact on turnover intentions through mediation of job burnout. Practical implications The study helps managers identify the psychological ramifications of defensive silence and the underlying mechanism that connects this to employee outcomes. It also highlights the plausible danger zones in which the employees lose self-expression and show symptoms of exhaustion and cynicism, thus ultimately affecting their performance and withdrawal behaviors. Originality/value The current study contributes to employee behavior literature by considering silence as an organizational loss in the backdrop of the COR theory which initiates loss process that leads to further losses in individuals.",art
10.1108/PR-07-2020-0507,"Abrasive leaders who changed: learning from their experience. Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the experience of three formerly abrasive leaders who improved their conduct and management strategies following a workplace intervention.Design/methodology/approach- Narrative inquiry, a personal and collaborative research method, revealed the experience of three leaders in their shift from destructive behaviors. Concepts from adult development, specifically Kegan's constructive-development theory (CDT) and Mezirow's transformative learning theory (TL), provided a lens to better understand the leaders' personal development.Findings - This study culminated with three co-composed narrative accounts and an analysis of narrative threads. The focus of this paper is the interpretive narrative thread analysis. The developmental experience of these three leaders included disruption, awakening and equipping.Research limitations/implications - This study included three leaders. The experience of these leaders may not be representative of other formerly abrasive leaders.Practical implications - This initial exploratory study contributes to CDT and TL by suggesting leader interpersonal development is an intensely emotional experience that transcends the mechanics of developmental stages. In practice, this study indicates abrasive leaders may improve their conduct and management strategies with organizational support, including supervisor intervention and specialized professionals.Originality/value - This paper offers insight for scholars and human resource (HR) professionals on the emotionally intense experiential journey of leaders who improved their interpersonal conduct. This study introduces concepts from CDT and TL into the study of workplace psychological aggression (WPA), and it expands the limited knowledge of how HR can support positive perpetrator change.",art

The study examined the relations between job automation, fear of job loss and self-actualization. Design/methodology/approach Using mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative analysis) with 539 participants overall, we examined employees' attitudes toward job automation through two separate studies conducted in a large public organization that employs blue-, white- and pink-collar employees. The blue-collar workers who participated consisted of waste collectors, gardeners and parking supervisors whose work is at risk of job automation. Findings We found that 74% of the blue-collar employees described technology as a replacer that simplifies and reduces human work activities, while only 3% perceived it as an enabler that could enrich their jobs and expand human potential. Fifty-three percent of the employees in the white-collar professions described technology as a replacer, and 36% perceived it as an enabler. Among pink-collar workers, 51% perceived technology as an enabler, while only 14% perceived it as a replacer. A positive relationship between job automation and self-actualization was evident for pink- and white-collar workers, but not for blue-collar workers. Originality/value This study sheds light on how employees in different types of jobs perceive technological advancements at work. A classification of the perception of technology as an enabler vs a replacer is presented. The relationships between job automation and self-actualization in different job types are explored.",art

Purpose This research analyzed the existing academic and grey literature concerning the technologies and practices of people analytics (PA), to understand how ethical considerations are being discussed by researchers, industry experts and practitioners, and to identify gaps, priorities and recommendations for ethical practice. Design/methodology/approach An iterative scoping review method was used to capture and synthesize relevant academic and grey literature. This is suited to emerging areas of innovation where formal research lags behind evidence from professional or technical sources. Findings Although the grey literature contains a growing stream of publications aimed at helping PA practitioners to be ethical, overall, research on ethical issues in PA is still at an early stage. Optimistic and technocentric perspectives dominate the PA discourse, although key themes seen in the wider literature on digital/data ethics are also evident. Risks and recommendations for PA projects concerned transparency and diverse stakeholder inclusion, respecting privacy rights, fair and proportionate use of data, fostering a systemic culture of ethical practice, delivering benefits for employees, including ethical outcomes in business models, ensuring legal compliance and using ethical charters. Research limitations/implications This research adds to current debates over the future of work and employment in a digitized, algorithm-driven society. Practical implications The research provides an accessible summary of the risks, opportunities, trade-offs and regulatory issues for PA, as well as a framework for integrating ethical strategies and practices. Originality/value By using a scoping methodology to surface and analyze diverse literatures, this study fills a gap in existing knowledge on ethical aspects of PA.

10.1108/PR-09-2022-0636,"The internal synergy effect of the dual-oriented HRM system on employee ethical behaviors. PurposeMore and more literature points out that compared to fragmented strategic HRM, interactive or internally consistent HR systems can generate synergies and more effectively predict employee outcomes. Different HR subsystems (such as performance-oriented and maintenance-oriented HRM practices), respectively, play a critical role for organizations and employees. However, the impact of the synergy effect of different practices within the HRM system is less concerning to researchers. Based on self-regulation theory, this paper explores the congruence effects within the dual-oriented HR system on employee ethical behaviors (prosocial/unethical behavior).Design/methodology/approachData were collected in a two-wave survey from 252 employees working in high-tech and service companies in China. Polynomial regression and response surface analyses were used to examine the hypotheses.FindingsThe results indicate that the internal congruence of performance-oriented and maintenance-oriented HRM practices is positively related to employees' prosocial behavior but negatively related to employees' unethical behavior. Employees have more prosocial behavior and less unethical behavior when they perceive the high-performance-oriented and high-maintenance-oriented HRM practices than the low-performance-oriented and low-maintenance-oriented HRM practices. Employees also have more prosocial behavior and less unethical behavior when they perceive the low performance-oriented and high maintenance-oriented HRM practices than the high performance-oriented and low maintenance-oriented HRM practices.Originality/valueDrawing on self-regulation theory and the Yin-Yang balancing perspective, this paper extends the limited understanding of the influence of dual-oriented HR system internal congruence between performance-oriented and maintenance-oriented HRM practices on employee behaviors. This paper is of great significance for a better understanding of the complexity and potential of HR systems.",art

PurposeDrawing on the integrative perspective of the technology acceptance model (TAM) and theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and extending it further by examining the role of organisational facilitators and perceived HR effectiveness in this integrative perspective, we examine HR professionals' AI-augmented HRM (HRM(AI)) acceptance in this research.Design/methodology/approachThe data (N=375) were collected from HR professionals working in different organisations in India. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed to analyse the data.FindingsThe results of the study suggest that along with organisational facilitator antecedents to the relevant components of both TAM and TPB, perceived HR effectiveness also enhanced the HRM(AI) acceptance levels of HR professionals.Practical implicationsThe research findings are expected to contribute to the understanding of the factors that influence the acceptance of AI-augmented HRM in organizations. The results may also help organisations to identify the facilitators that can enhance the adoption and implementation of AI-augmented HRM by HR professionals. Finally, the study provides a composite TAM-TPB theoretical framework that can guide future research on the acceptance of AI-augmented HRM.Originality/valueTo the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to factor in the effect of contextual factors (i.e. organisational facilitators and perceived HR effectiveness) in the TAM and TPB equations.",art

PurposeThe purpose of this study is to investigate the boundary conditions between objective overqualification and perceived overqualification. In addition, we aim to investigate the mediation patterns between objective overqualification, perceived overqualification and job satisfaction.Design/methodology/approachA two-wave survey was conducted with 382 new entrants of job market. Data was analyzed with Process 3.5 in SPSS 26.0 to test the hypothesized moderated mediation model.FindingsResults indicated that perceived overqualification fully mediated the relationship between objective overqualification and job satisfaction. In addition, the relationship between objective overqualification and perceived overqualification was significant unless employees perceived high internal employment opportunities but low external employment opportunities at the same time. Same moderating pattern was also evident in the indirect effect of objective overqualification? Perceived overqualification? Job satisfaction.Research limitations/implicationsThis study has theoretical and practical implications for personnel management. Theoretically, this study contributed to the understanding of the relationship between objective overqualification and perceived overqualification. Practically, this study found that offering internal employment opportunities can mitigate the perception of overqualification when employees perceive limited external employment opportunities.Originality/valueThis is one of few studies that stressed the boundary conditions between objective overqualification and perceived overqualification under the framework of relative deprivation theory.

PurposeAlthough strengths use support (SUS) has been shown to facilitate employee strengths use and work engagement, little is known about how senior managers' SUS affects middle managers' SUS. The purpose of the present research was to examine the trickle-down effect of SUS from superiors on SUS for subordinates.Design/methodology/approachA two-wave questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data from middle managers (n = 228) at a global manufacturing firm in Japan.FindingsThe results of structural equation modeling indicated that (1) SUS from superiors indirectly promoted SUS for subordinates mediated through middle managers' strength use, and (2) SUS from superiors indirectly promoted SUS for subordinates mediated through middle managers' strength use, and subsequently through their work engagement.Research limitations/implicationsAs the respondents were middle-level managers at a manufacturing firm in Japan and were all Japanese nationals, indigenous culture and traditional work mentality may have affected the results.Practical implicationsTo create a supportive learning culture in an organization, human resource (HR) managers need to encourage senior-level managers to provide SUS for middle managers through HR systems such as training, appraisal, and survey feedback.Originality/valueThis study may be the first to clarify how SUS from superiors is linked to SUS for subordinates by identifying the mediating effects of strength use and work engagement, based on the Job-Demand Resources model, the Social Cognitive theory, and the trickle-down effect.",art

PurposeThis study explored one form of remote working - work from home - to understand the impact of work disruptions on workers and human resource management (HRM) practice and therefore how to adapt to future crises. Specifically, the purpose is to understand the impact of events on employees when they are forced to move back and forth (yo-yoing) between work from home and a central office, using the case of Perth, Western Australia (WA).Design/methodology/approachThirty-nine interviews with leaders, managers and co-workers working in private and public organisations suggest that forced changes to work arrangements affect job content and demands, well-being and potentially career trajectories.FindingsThe authors critically applied and developed the tenets of event system theory (EST) (novelty, disruption and criticality) by analysing an ongoing or long event rather than a discrete or time-limited one. The study found that the work-from-home experience influenced the individual perception of whether remote working would suit employees in the future, potentially influencing career paths. In addition, the selection of locations to live, preferred properties (e.g. home office space) and access to services (e.g. broadband infrastructure) has also become dominant features of work decisions.Research limitations/implicationsWhile the study generated rich data, it is not without limitations. The participants were from one Australian state which may not reflect the COVID-19 experiences of other jurisdictions. In addition, the participants were mostly female so this may offer a different perspective than a more gender-balanced sample. The study was limited to the perspectives of employees and middle managers.Practical implicationsThe authors note three areas of implications for practitioners. First, the findings suggest that strong organisational and HRM support assists employees to cope well with change. Second, the importance of technological and social preparedness in improving employee experiences highlights the role of HRM in job design. Third, it is key that salient events are recognised as potential determinants of career pathways.Originality/valueThe evidence from this research broadens the application of EST showing that forced flexibility has an influence on work arrangements by influencing a series of changes in features of work and experiences of employees. As such, this impacts employee's well-being and potentially future career decisions.",art

PurposeIntegrating appraisal theories of discrete emotions with the emotion regulation literature, this study aims to explore the relationships between exploitative leadership and certain types of counterproductive workplace behavior (CWB). Besides, this study seeks to examine the mediating roles of discrete emotions (i.e. anger and fear) and the moderating role of cognitive reappraisal within the proposed relationships.Design/methodology/approachBased on time-lagged survey data from 440 Chinese employees, this study conducted hierarchical regression analysis and bootstrapping approach to test the hypotheses.FindingsThe results revealed that exploitative leadership was positively related to approach-oriented CWB and avoidance-oriented CWB. In addition, this study found that anger mediated the relationship between exploitative leadership and approach-oriented CWB, whereas fear mediated the relationship between exploitative leadership and avoidance-oriented CWB. Further, cognitive reappraisal buffered the positive effects of exploitative leadership on anger and fear and the indirect effects of exploitative leadership on approach-oriented CWB (via anger) and avoidance-oriented CWB (via fear).Practical implicationsManagers should reduce leaders' exploitation and enhance employees' skills on emotional management and cognitive reappraisal.Originality/valueFirst, by verifying the effects of exploitative leadership on both approach-oriented and avoidance-oriented CWB, this study adds to the literature on exploitive leadership and provides a more complete understating of the relationship between exploitative leadership and workplace deviance. Second, this study enriches the understanding of the process through which exploitative leadership affects employees by demonstrating the novel mediating roles of discrete emotions (i.e. anger and fear) through the lens of appraisal theories of discrete emotions. Third, by verifying the moderating role of cognitive reappraisal, this study provides insights into the boundary conditions of the influences of exploitive leadership.",art

Purpose Literature around the careers of female academics is targeted mainly toward identifying and examining career progression inhibitors, while the drivers appear largely unexplored. This paper aims to contribute to contemporary knowledge by identifying drivers to the career progression of female academics in Australia. With COVID-19 currently impacting the careers of female academics this knowledge can assist universities and human resource (HR) professionals in developing policies and practices to better facilitate female academic career progression. Design/methodology/approach Empirically this paper draws on a qualitative study of 18 male and 29 female academics, as well as nine senior university stakeholders. The authors employed semi-structured interviews and a novel methodology, Draw, Write, Reflect. Findings In line with attribution theory, senior stakeholders mainly identified organisational efforts, including leadership, gender equity endeavours, recruitment and promotion approaches, as well as a construct known as relative to opportunity considerations, as drivers of female academics' career progression. Female academics, however, largely attributed their career progression to personal factors, such as family support, informal mentoring, and determination and persistence. Practical implications The findings have implications for universities and HR practices seeking to facilitate female academic career progression. Implementation of the drivers identified may enhance female academics' abilities to progress their careers. Originality/value By focussing on the drivers of, rather than the barriers to, female academic careers, the research is novel in its identification of a previously unexplored mismatch between organisational attribution and individual attribution of career progression drivers thereby advancing knowledge of gender differences in academic careers.",art
10.1108/PR-04-2021-0259,"Crafting telework: a process model of need satisfaction to foster telework outcomes. Purpose The purpose of this study is to offer a model explicating telework as a dynamic process, theorizing that teleworkers continuously adjust - their identities, boundaries and relationships - to meet their own needs for competence, autonomy and relatedness in their work and nonwork roles. Design/methodology/approach This study uses the lens of job crafting to posit changes teleworkers make to enhance work-nonwork balance and job performance, including time-related individual differences to account for contingencies in dynamic adjustments. Finally, this study discusses how feedback from work and nonwork role partners and one's self-evaluation results in an iterative process of learning to telework over time. Findings This model describes how teleworkers craft work and nonwork roles to satisfy needs, enhancing key outcomes and eliciting role partner feedback to further recraft telework. Research limitations/implications The propositions can be translated to hypotheses. As such the dynamic model for crafting telework can be used as a basis for empirical studies aimed at understanding how telework adjustment process unfolds. Practical implications Intervention studies could focus on teleworkers' job crafting behavior. Organizations may also offer training to prepare employees to telework and to create conditions under which teleworkers' job crafting behavior more easily translates into need satisfaction and positive outcomes. Social implications Many employees would prefer to work from home, at least partly, when the COVID-19 crisis is over. This model offers a way to facilitate a smooth transition into this work mode while ensuring work nonwork balance and performance. Originality/value Most telework research takes a static approach to focus on the work-family interface. This study proffers a dynamic approach suggesting need satisfaction as the mechanism enabling one to combine work and domestic roles and delineating how feedback enables continuous adjustment in professional and personal roles.",art
10.1108/PR-09-2020-0669,"Informal learning effort and attitude toward knowledge sharing in times of workplace conflict: curious case of joyous exploration and deprivation sensitivity. Purpose The study examined the impact of two dimensions of curiosity: joyous exploration (JE) and deprivation sensitivity (DSv) on informal learning effort (ILE) and attitude toward knowledge sharing (ATKS). The authors further explored the mediating effect of learning culture (LC) in the organization on the relationship of the two curiosity dimensions with ILE and ATKS. Additionally, the authors investigated the moderating effect of group dynamics in the form of intragroup task conflict (ITC) and relationship conflict (IRC) on the relationship of curiosity variables with LC, ILE and ATKS. Design/methodology/approach Survey instrument was distributed to 790 knowledge workers in various organizations through their HR managers. 403 responses were returned and used in the study. Findings JE, the self-determined manifestation of curiosity, impacts all elements of ILE and ATKS, while DSv influences a few aspects of ILE. The effect of JE on the dependent variables is, however, more substantial at low levels of ITC. ITC and IRC independently impact ILE, but only ITC moderates the relationships involving JE (but not DSv). LC emerges from JE (but not from DSv) and partially mediates its association with ILE and ATKS. Originality/value Through this work, we demonstrate the differential relevance of the curiosity dimensions and the intragroup conflict types - and their interaction effect - on learning effort and attitude toward knowledge sharing. The findings of the study open new avenues for interventions within the workplace learning and knowledge sharing domain.",art
10.1108/PR-04-2020-0305,"Displacement-plurality (D-P) in women refugees, its influence on work engagement and implications for diversity practice: a critical and reflective review. Purpose Much of the current research on women refugees and work focuses solely on settlement, neglecting the effects of displacement within this equation, despite its significant impact. Drawing from the wider literature of international development, migration, gender, work psychology and sociology, this paper provides a framework to guide informed research within this area. Design/methodology/approach This paper is a reflective and critical review of the intersection between gender, forced displacement and work. It addresses a blind spot in the current work literature, which fails to address the impact of displacement on refugee women and the consequences of displacement for vocational engagement during resettlement. Findings This paper contributes to the current literature in four ways. First, it adds forced displacement to the peripheral-intersections literature informing Acker's theory of inequality regimes. Secondly, it contributes to a deeper understanding of how pluralities and intersectionality develop during forced displacement, by introducing the theory of displacement-plurality (D-P). Thirdly, it contributes to human resource management (HRM) diversity practice by explaining the relationship between D-P and related constructs, such as work engagement (WE), economic empowerment (EE), work-related factors (WRFs) and psycho-social factors (PSFs) to help improve localised diversity practices in relation to refugee populations. Fourthly, it provides a detailed framework to guide research and practice in this area, supported by a critical evaluation of the current refugee work literature. Originality/value When we understand displacement-related factors, we can move towards a more emancipatory approach to intersectionality, allowing us to develop more sophisticated approaches to diversity in organisations. In turn, this helps us to understand people's lived experiences and their responses to organisational interventions more effectively.",art

Purpose Dual-careers are an increasingly common typology among professionals yet very few studies have considered how two potentially competing career trajectories are managed in relation to the broader aspects of life, such as family and personal life. This article addresses the gap through an exploration of the strategies adopted by dual-career professional couples as they seek to navigate these challenges whilst satisfying individual and shared goals and aspirations. Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were carried out with 18 couples (dyads) from a range of professional occupations. Interviews were conducted individually, and then responses analysed and compared for key themes. Findings Rather than focusing on how couples manage work-life balance on a day-today basis this study shows how couples incorporate a more strategic approach to dual-careers so that both careers are able to progress, albeit within situational constraints. Practical implications To satisfy personal, business and economic performance goals, organisations and governments will need to find more creative ways to support employees as they seek to navigate careers while balancing the work and nonwork needs of themselves and their partner. The challenges faced by dual-career couples have implications for human resource managers as they seek to attract and retained talent within their organisations. Social implications Demographic and social changes at the household level will ultimately require changes at an organisational and broader societal level to meet the work and family needs of this growing cohort. Originality/value Rather than focusing on how couples manage work-life balance on a day-today basis this study shows how couples incorporate a more strategic approach to dual-careers so that both careers are able to progress, albeit within situational constraints.",art

Purpose This study investigates the effect of supervisor-directed organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) on leader-member exchange (LMX), the moderating role of impression management motives on this relationship, the effect of LMX on organizational and interpersonal deviance and the mediating effect of LMX on the relationship between supervisor-directed OCB and deviant behaviors. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a survey questionnaire to collect data. Respondents were 342 nonmanagerial employees working in Surabaya Raya, Indonesia. Hypothesis testing is done using Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings The results show that supervisor-directed OCB is positively related to LMX, and LMX is negatively related to organizational deviance but not significantly related to interpersonal deviance. The study also finds that impression management motives moderate the positive relationship between supervisor-directed OCB and LMX. Furthermore, LMX mediates the relationship between supervisor-directed OCB and organizational deviance, but not interpersonal deviance. Practical implications This study suggests the importance of human resource management (HRM) activities and managers being aware of subordinate OCB motives and the impact of LMX on interpersonal and organizational deviance, as well as what supervisors need to do to reduce these negative effects. Originality/value Few studies examined the relationship between supervisor-directed OCB and workplace deviance behaviors (WDBs). This study provides a mechanism of their relationship by considering LMX as a mediator. Also, heretofore the existing studies tend to focus more on LMX as an antecedent of OCB. This study provides an understanding of OCB as an antecedent of LMX with the moderating effect of impression management motives.",art

Purpose - This study applies a person-environment fit (PEF) framework to examine the extent to which organizational attractiveness may be influenced by person-organization fit (POF) feedback and person-job fit (PJF) feedback in web-based recruitment. Furthermore, the potential mediating roles of subjective POF and subjective PJF perceptions were examined.Design/methodology/approach - Senior undergraduate business administration students participated in a two-stage experiment by completing a paper-and-pencil survey during a campus career fair and then reviewing a recruitment website.Findings - Research findings showed that online assessment feedback on PJF was positively related to organizational attractiveness. The higher the level PJF, the more organizational attractiveness participants reported. Second, both POF and PJF feedback information can affect organizational attractiveness indirectly through subjective POF and PJF perceptions, respectively. Fresh graduates were more sensitive to PJF feedback in deciding organizational attractiveness.Originality/value - This study contributes to the recruitment literature in at least three ways. First, online recruitment messages concerning can affect organizational attractiveness. Second, in support of the PEF framework, fresh graduates can distinguish subjective POF perceptions from subjective PJF perceptions. Third, fresh graduates are more sensitive to PJF information and perceptions in deciding organizational attractiveness.",art

Purpose This study aims to understand the role of employee competencies in terms of the relationship between Human Resource Practices (HRPs) and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach A sample of 60 HR managers and 546 employees from large-scale food processing firms were considered for the study. The study presents a 2-1-2 multilevel mediational analysis in which HRPs and firm performance are measured at the firm level (Level-2) and employee competencies are measured at employee level (Level-1). Findings Positive relationship was found between HRPs and firm performance, which was partially mediated by employee competencies. Practical implications The study highlights the importance of employee-related factors by focusing on the wider dimensions of human capital (e.g. academic qualification, job experience) in HRPs-performance relationship. Originality/value The study undertakes a 2-1-2 multilevel mediational analysis, which is rarely applied in HRM studies; however, this interaction between macro- and microlevel effects will create a better understanding of organization studies from an integrated and multilevel context.",art
10.1108/PR-06-2020-0453,"Contexts of organizational learning in developing countries: the role of training programmes in Egyptian public banks. Purpose Little research into organizational learning in the public sector in developing countries' is known. In this paper, the authors investigated the context of organizational learning in the public banks in Egypt. Design/methodology/approach An ethnographic field research was employed by spending a month inside each of two public banks in Egypt. The ethnographic experience was operationalised by using direct observations of learning processes, procedures and practices, semi-structured interviews with learning specialists and focus group discussions with bankers. The authors used thematic analysis to determine the main themes in the previous data collection methods of ethnographic approach. Findings The findings confirmed a lack of clear focus for the organizational learning practices employed by the banks, which highlights issues of seriousness in undertaking and/or tackling organizational learning, and increased doubts in relation to the added value of the different forms of formal trainings bankers participate in. To enhance the culture and maintain effective functioning of formal organizational learning, the authors suggest considering the following three categories of barriers: purpose-related barriers, implementation and evaluation barriers. Originality/value Despite the generalisability caveats associated with the organizations studied, the authors believe that this paper contributes to the existing theory of organizational learning as it provides insights and understanding on the purpose, frame, conduct and results of organizational learning in the public sector. More specifically, the study is unique and is different from previous relevant studies as it relies on ethnographical approach in exploring how organizational leaning practices are perceived in public banks in developing countries.",art
10.1108/PR-01-2020-0007,"How abusive supervision ultimately might enhance performance ratings among silent, neurotic employees. Purpose With a theoretical anchoring in the conservation of resources (COR) theory, this study investigates how employees' exposure to abusive supervision ultimately might lead to enhanced supervisor ratings of their job performance because employees react with defensive silence. Employees' neuroticism also might catalyze this process. Design/methodology/approach Multi-source, three-wave data were collected from employees and their supervisors in the power-distant, collectivistic country of Pakistan. Findings Beliefs about the presence of verbally abusive leaders, somewhat ironically, mitigate the risk of diminished supervisor-rated performance evaluations to the extent that those beliefs prompt employees to engage in self-protective behaviors to avoid confrontations with the abusive leaders. This mediating role of defensive silence is invigorated to the extent that employees' personalities make them more sensitive to stressful work situations. Practical implications For practitioners, this study identifies self-protective silence as a key, potentially worrisome mechanism that employees in power-distant, collectivistic countries may use to avoid negative performance ratings by leaders they perceive as abusive, and it reveals how this process tends to vary across different employees. Originality/value This research cites a critical, unexplored factor through which verbally abused employees can avoid negative performance evaluations, by engaging in defensive silence, not only as a potentially detrimental solution but also as an effective short-term solution. It further clarifies that this process is more likely to occur among neurotic employees.",art
10.1108/PR-09-2019-0508,"Keep your mouth shut until I feel good: testing the moderated mediation model of leader's threat to competence, self-defense tactics, and voice rejection. Purpose Although voice endorsement is essential for individuals, teams and organizational performance, leaders who consider followers' voice to be threatening are reluctant to implement followers' ideas. The authors, taking note of this phenomenon, investigate why leaders who feel a threat from followers' voice exhibit voice rejection at the workplace and when this detrimental tendency can be diminished. Thus, based on the self-defense tendency as per self-affirmation theory, the authors argue that those leaders who experience threat triggered by followers' voice, justify voice rejection through the self-defense tactics: message derogation and source derogation. In addition, the authors also propose that a leader's positive (negative) affect experienced before voice exposure may decrease (increase) self-defense and voice rejection. Design/methodology/approach To test the authors' moderated mediation model, they conducted two independent vignette studies (N = 269; N = 208). The purpose of the first vignette study was to test the simple mediation (i.e. the direct and indirect effects), whereas the second study aimed to test the moderated mediation model. Findings In Study 1, the authors found that the leader's perceived threat to competence provoked by followers' voice was positively related to voice rejection, and the relationship was partially mediated by message derogation and source derogation. In line with this, in Study 2, the authors tested the moderated mediation model and replicated the findings of Study 1. They found that the effects of leader's perceived threat to competence on voice rejection through self-defense tactics are weaker (stronger) at the high (low) values of a leader's positive affect. In contrast, the effects of a leader's perceived threat to competence on voice rejection through self-defense tactics are stronger (weaker) at the high (low) values of a leader's negative affect. Originality/value This study suggests that leaders who experience a threat to competence instigated by employee voice are more likely to think that ideas proposed by employees are non-constructive and employees who suggest those ideas are not credible, and these appraisals have a direct influence on voice rejection. However, if leaders are in a good mood vs. bad mood, they will be less likely to think negatively about employees and their ideas even when they experience psychological threats. The findings highlight several avenues for future researchers to extend the literature on employee voice management and leadership coaching by providing theoretical and managerial implications.",art

Purpose Data were collected using a survey questionnaire of 379 participants from business process outsourcing (BPO) organizations affected by robotic process automation (RPA). Structural equation modelling and hierarchical regression analysis were used to test the hypothesized relationships between the study variables. Design/methodology/approach The purpose of this paper is to develop and test a moderated-mediation model examining the relationships between uncertainty around changes due to RPA, neuroticism and job insecurity, and turnover intentions among BPO employees in India. Findings Uncertainty around RPA and neuroticism cause job insecurity among employees resulting in their intent to quit the organization. Further, the impact of job insecurity is influenced by employees' commitment to automation. Outlining the ways in which RPA-driven change impacts employees and organizations, our findings underscore the need for upskilling the affected employees besides developing coping mechanisms as a buffer to the negative impacts of large-scale automation-driven transformation in the industry under study. Originality/value Amidst the debate around the impact of RPA in developing countries, our research is the first attempt to systematically examine how RPA has led to concerns around job security leading to turnover intention among employees in the Indian BPO sector. It uniquely highlights the role of personality besides the issue of growing uncertainty due to RPA, requiring the immediate attention of organizations.",art

Purpose-The purpose of this research is to examine the relationship of perceptions of organizational justice on the ranking of candidates for incentive bonuses and the impact of organizational culture on these perceptions.Design/methodology/approach-A questionnaire was developed which asked respondents to rank a set of seven candidates for a sales bonus based on deservingness for the bonus. Descriptions of the candidates included information not only on whether they achieved a pre-established metric for the bonus, but on how they achieved (or failed to achieve) the metric. Hypotheses related compliance with norms of organizational justice, both by candidates and the organization, to candidate rank. The survey was administered to a sample of 204 employees of business organizations at all levels obtained through a survey research firm, as well as a sample of 52 employees of organizations in the Christian publishing industry. Nonparametric statistics were used to analyze the results. A comparison was made between the respondents sourced through the research firm, seen as representing the general population and those from the Christian-oriented group.Findings- Hypotheses that respondents will seek to punish violators of justice norms, reward compliers and compensate victims of organizational unfairness were generally supported. More interesting were differences between the groups of respondents from the general population and the group representing Christian-based firms.Originality/value-This article reveals the impact of organizational culture on the acceptance of incentive systems. The research employed a practitioner survey, rather than more common experimental approach.",art
10.1002/hrm.22198,"Effects of formal mentoring support on newcomer-protege affective organizational commitment: a self-concept-based perspective. The study proposes and tests a self-concept-based perspective for the effects of formal mentoring support on affective organizational commitment (AOC) via multiple mediators. Using time-lagged multi-source dyadic data (n = 203), we demonstrate that formal mentoring support significantly influences newcomer-proteges' AOC through an underlying self-evaluative mechanism indicated by organization-based self-esteem (OBSE), even in the presence of a well-established alternative mediator (perceived organizational support; POS). Moreover, we further demonstrate when or under what circumstances such effects might be attenuated or exaggerated by introducing a salient boundary condition to such a process (i.e., perceived mentor organizational prototypicality). As the findings reveal, by making newcomer-proteges feel good about themselves in the workplace (i.e., perceive self-value) formal mentoring support can also promote organizational commitment, effects that are likely to be amplified when the formal mentor is perceived to be prototypical of the organization. Thus, bridging the mentoring and socialization literatures, the inclusion of our proposed mediators and moderator and testing their relationships simultaneously not only provides a more nuanced view of the underlying mechanisms through which the effects of formal mentoring support are channeled to influence newcomer-proteges' work attitudes but it offers new theoretical elaboration and contextual understanding that we hope will prompt future research and be of benefit to human resource practitioners. Implications to theory, practice and future research directions are discussed.",art
10.1002/hrm.22152,"A relational perspective on supervisor-initiated turnover: Implications for human resource management based on a multi-method investigation of leader-member exchange relationships. Despite the great emphasis organizations and human resource management (HRM) research place on turnover issues, one turnover phenomenon has received only limited attention so far: joint leader-member turnover. This research examines supervisor-initiated turnover (SIT) (i.e., employees' decision to quit their employer to follow a former supervisor to a new organization) and develops a comprehensive model of the SIT decision process, grounded on conservation of resources (COR) theory, that delineates the resource evaluation, conservation and investment deliberations of employees. We take a relational perspective and particularly focus on the leader-member relationship as an important antecedent of SIT and thereby respond to the call for more critical investigations of leader-member exchange (LMX) and corresponding HRM implications. Our three studies (survey, scenario experiment, and dyadic interview study) demonstrate that LMX positively affects SIT intentions (SITI) and that supervisor commitment represents an important mediating mechanism of the LMX-SITI relationship. Our interview study with 46 leader-member dyads identifies relational factors that promote or hinder SIT beyond the leader-member relationship. We discuss the theoretical contributions and practical implications for HRM.",art
10.1002/hrm.22120,"Dynamism and realignment in the HR architecture: Online labor platform ecosystems and the key role of contractors. Given the widespread contribution of independent contractors to organizational innovation and competitive advantage, it is timely to reassess assumptions about the HRM practices appropriate to their management and the rationale for organizations to work with them. In the original and highly influential HR architecture model of Lepak and Snell (1999), contractor status is viewed as an outcome of the low value and/or low uniqueness of human capital resulting in the proposition to externalize and manage them using either none or minimal compliance-based HRM practices. Developments in digital technologies and algorithmic management epitomized by online labor platforms prompt us to reconsider these assumptions and to challenge the proposed links between value/uniqueness of human capital, employment mode and HRM practices that are assumed by the HR architecture model. Using insights from online labor platforms, we argue that the significant benefits to firms of working with contractors, coupled with the possibilities offered by algorithmic management to efficiently monitor and regulate their behavior, provide a compelling reason for organizations to choose external employment modes even when workers are key to value creation. We challenge the alignment and stability of the relationships proposed by the HR architecture model, and offer propositions to extend the model by reconsidering the rationale for, and nature of, HRM practices associated with contractors. This reassessment is both timely and relevant given the growing prominence of business models where externalizing workers is central alongside the development of new forms of algorithmic human resource management to control them.",art
10.1002/hrm.22112,"Emphasizing me or we: Training framing and self-concept in network-based leadership development. This study explores how the motivational framing of a network training program may positively or (inadvertently) adversely impact participants' discomfort with strategic networking and motivation to network. We examine the impact of a me-focused framing (i.e., on the personal career benefits that individuals can accrue through strategic networking) and a we-focused framing (i.e., on the benefits to the team/organization of individuals' strategic networking) compared to a control group in two field-based quasi-experiments. In both studies, we found no difference between the two training frames in their effect on the two training outcomes when looking at participants' reactions, on average. However, in the second study, we find that individual differences in the way participants relate to others (i.e., the extent to which they endorse an individual or a collective self-concept) change the impact of the framing on their discomfort with and motivation to network. The findings highlight the importance of considering the match or mismatch between training framing and self-concept. In the we-focused condition, a match was related to decreased networking discomfort, while a mismatch was related to increased discomfort and decreased motivation. In the me-focused condition, a mismatch was counter-intuitively related to decreased discomfort. These findings suggest that considering participants' reactions to training (i.e., change in discomfort and motivation), on average, may mask important differences in their response to network-based training and that tailoring network training to participants' self-concepts may be an important consideration for human resource management professionals.",art
10.1002/hrm.22078,"Exploring the pandemic's potential effects on workers' collectivist values, prosocial behaviors, and attitudes toward mistreatment. The global COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the way we live and work in the short-term, but history suggests that the crisis may also exert deeper, longer-lasting effects. With the aim of providing preliminary insight into this possibility, we theoretically construct and empirically test hypotheses for how exposure to COVID-19 stimuli (e.g., reading or watching media coverage, observing relief efforts) relates to the deep-seated values that guide workers' attitudes and behaviors. Specifically, we build from prior work to posit that exposure to COVID-19 stimuli is positively associated with workers' self-transcendent prosocial values, which motivate prosocial behaviors directed toward society as a whole (i.e., charitable donations) and coworkers (i.e., helping). Extend the extant literature, we further argue that exposure to COVID-19 stimuli will be positively associated with conservation values emphasizing self-restraint, submission, protection of order, and harmony in relations, which in turn influences workers' willingness to tolerate mistreatment by authorities (i.e., abusive supervision, authoritarian leadership, exploitation). Evidence from 2,929 full-time Chinese employees tracked for nearly 2 months and a diverse sample of 310 workers in the United States generally support our arguments, but also provide insight into potential cultural nuances.",art
10.1002/hrm.22076,"The effects of negative mentoring experiences on mentor creativity: The roles of mentor ego depletion and traditionality. The literature often focuses on the positive effects of mentoring, especially for proteges. When mentoring experiences are negative, the assumption is that these negative effects are less detrimental to the mentor than to the protege, owing to the mentor's greater relative power in the relationship. This study uses ego depletion theory to examine the link between negative mentoring experiences (as rated by proteges) and mentor creativity and focuses on the mediating and moderating roles of mentor ego depletion and mentor traditionality on this link. The results are based on data from 227 proteges, 187 mentors, and 187 supervisors of mentors in Chinese organizations. The findings support a mediating effect of ego depletion on the negative relationship between negative mentoring experiences and mentor creativity. In addition, the study finds that traditionality attenuates both the positive relationship between negative mentoring experiences and ego depletion and the indirect effect of negative mentoring experiences on mentors' creativity through ego depletion. The implications for management theory and practice are discussed.",art
10.1108/PR-01-2024-0090,"Skilled migrant hiring and selection: organisations' challenges in embracing diversity in recruitment. Purpose-This paper used Zikic's (2015) integrated framework for managing diversity to review the skilled migrant literature and explore reasons non-English-speaking background (NESB) skilled migrants (SMs) are disadvantaged in the host country recruitment market. This research examines organisations' role in attracting and facilitating the entry of NESB SMs to their organisations and embracing diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Design/methodology/approach-The authors conducted a systematic literature review following the integrated framework combining the intelligent career theory and the resource-based view. This framework allows the exploration of the challenges NESB SMs face with their career capital in the host country concerning the people management systems and processes organisations often use in recruitment. Findings-This review revealed multiple challenges NESB SMs face when negotiating their workplace transition in the host country destinations. The study shows that the underutilisation and underemployment among NESB SMs are partly caused by these SMs' foreign experiences but mainly by the host countries' NESB SM-unfriendly recruitment practices. It also uncovers gaps between macro, meso and micro levels in SM recruitment. Research limitations/implications-A limitation inherent in a systematic literature review is that the effectiveness of the search is contingent upon the quality of the search strings used. Second, the core themes in the synthesis were identified following Zikic's (2015) integrated framework and focused only on individual/micro factors of SMs and meso/organisational factors. Many other structural and contextual factors were not included in the review. This review is also limited to NESB SMs' recruitment. Nonetheless, this process helps us achieve the core aim set for this review, to explore the reasons behind the hardships NESB SMs face when searching for ways to enter the host professional job market and the role of organisations in attracting and facilitating NESB SMs' labour market entry. Originality/value-This research connected NESB SMs' micro-level difficulties to the meso layer of organisations' HRM policies. This review clarified the role of organisational strategic HRM in attracting and welcoming NESB SMs into their organisation before leveraging their career diversity. The findings from the review also assisted in extending Zikic's (2015) integrated framework.",art

PurposeThis paper aims to provide an elucidative and explanatory overview of decision-making theory that human resource management and development (HR) researchers and practitioners can use to explore the impact of heuristics and biases on organizational decisions, particularly within HR contexts.Design/methodology/approachThis paper draws upon three theoretical resources anchored in decision-making research: the theory of bounded rationality, the heuristics and biases program, and cognitive-experiential self-theory (CEST). A selective narrative review approach was adopted to identify, translate, and contextualize research findings that provide immense applicability, connection, and significance to the field and study of HR.FindingsThe authors extract key insights from the theoretical resources surveyed and illustrate the linkages between HR and decision-making research, presenting a theoretical framework to guide future research endeavors.Practical implicationsDecades of decision-making research have been distilled into a digestible and accessible framework that offers both theoretical and practical implications.Originality/valueHeuristics are mental shortcuts that facilitate quick decisions by simplifying complexity and reducing effort needed to solve problems. Heuristic strategies can yield favorable outcomes, especially amid time and information constraints. However, heuristics can also introduce systematic judgment errors known as biases. Biases are pervasive within organizational settings and can lead to disastrous decisions. This paper provides HR scholars and professionals with a balanced, nuanced, and integrative framework to better understand heuristics and biases and explore their organizational impact. To that end, a forward-looking and direction-setting research agenda is presented.",art

Purpose - Despite ongoing reports of insider-driven leakage of confidential data, both academic scholars and practitioners tend to focus on external threats and favour information technology (IT)-centric solutions to secure and strengthen their information security ecosystem. Unfortunately, they pay little attention to human resource management (HRM) solutions. This paper aims to address this gap and proposes an actionable human resource (HR)-centric and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven framework. Design/methodology/approach - The paper highlights the dangers posed by insider threats and presents key findings from a Leximancer-based analysis of a rapid literature review on the role, nature and contribution of HRM for information security, especially in addressing insider threats. The study also discusses the limitations of these solutions and proposes an HR-in-the-loop model, driven by AI and machine learning to mitigate these limitations. Findings - The paper argues that AI promises to offer many HRM-centric opportunities to fortify the information security architecture if used strategically and intelligently. The HR-in-the-loop model can ensure that the human factors are considered when designing information security solutions. By combining AI and machine learning with human expertise, this model can provide an effective and comprehensive approach to addressing insider threats.

PurposeManagers of public organizations in liberalized sectors face the dual imperative of retaining skilled employees who might be poached by commercial competitors and improving service performance levels without a free hand to invest resources. While employee work engagement (EWE) has been previously suggested as a solution to such management challenges, limitations in its ability to retain employees have been identified. We therefore examine how a social identity crafting (SIC) approach to public leadership that confers a sense of group identity among team members can enhance and extend beyond EWE in addressing this dual imperative.Design/methodology/approachWe report findings from a survey of employees (n = 199) at ATCO, a state-owned national airline that is facing challenges from commercial rivals within a new, competitive environment.FindingsWe confirm previously identified limitations of EWE and, further, demonstrate that a social identity approach to leadership offers a promising avenue for public managers, not only by enhancing employee engagement but, more importantly, by enhancing retention and service performance.Originality/valueWe contribute to studies of leadership, particularly for managers operating in the public sector and resource-constrained environments, demonstrating how SIC, which does not require costly investment to attain, can deliver improved service performance and reduced employee turnover intention, operating beyond EWE, which reaches a plateau in respect of the latter.",art

Purpose Utilizing a self-regulatory perspective, the authors examine how narcissism influences perceived negative inequity and the downstream effects on self-enhancement motivation and organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) over time. Design/methodology/approach A total of 689 useable three-wave panel data were obtained via Amazon Mechanical Turk during a three-month period. A latent growth curve modeling approach using EQS 6.4 for Windows was employed to test the hypothesized model. Findings Results illustrate that individuals with higher levels of narcissism perceive higher levels of perceived negative inequity and then form higher levels of self-enhancement motivation, which prompt more OCB directed toward the organization (OCBO) than OCB directed toward individuals (OCBI). When perceived negative inequity increases over time, narcissists experience a faster increase in self-enhancement motivation, which also leads to a faster increase in OCBO compared to the increase in OCBI. Originality/value Theoretically, this study provides theoretical and empirical insights into understanding the process through which narcissists' OCBs are motivated. Practically, this study offers several practical recommendations that help managers manage OCBs effectively in the organization.",art

Purpose Social exchange theory predicts that perceptions of employee/employer exchange relationships may change as employees add educational qualifications. Literature also suggests that more innovative individuals, who are particularly important to organisations, may be more likely to change jobs. The purpose of this study is to test how the innovativeness of an individual differs in its contribution to retention when subjected to different mediating and moderating influences indicated in the literature, for a cohort of employees that are undertaking degree studies while working. Design/methodology/approach To test theory that suggests certain implications for employee turnover, the part-time studies unit of a large South African university offering degree studies by evening classes was sampled, yielding 323 useable responses, with a response rate of about 30%. Structural equation modelling (SEM) is used to test a theoretical model predicting certain mediating and moderating influences on the relationship between individual innovativeness and turnover intentions. Findings Individuals with higher innovativeness self-report higher turnover intentions, which seem to be reduced by the mediating effects of perceived supervisor support and job satisfaction. Perceptions of distributive justice and core self-evaluations, which may be associated with an individual's evaluation of the social exchange relationship, are found to directly enable retention.

Purpose Through focusing on gig workers registered in three crowdsourcing platforms, the authors investigate how individual and collaborative job crafting may be positively related to the meaningful work and affective commitment those gig workers develop towards the crowdsourcing platforms they register in. Design/methodology/approach The authors employed a quantitative research method in which they focused on date from surveys completed by 327 gig workers. They tested the hypotheses using SmartPLS 3, which is more suitable when dealing with complex models, non-normal data, small samples and higher-order constructs. Findings The results showed that the proactive behaviour embedded within both individual and collaborative job crafting may lead to a sense of meaningfulness for gig workers and subsequently, their affective commitment towards the crowdsourcing platforms they register in. Specifically, the more gig workers undertake individual (H1) and collaborative (H2) job crafting behaviour, the greater the sense of meaningfulness they develop. Moreover, meaningfulness for gig workers positively affects their affective commitment towards the crowdsourcing platforms they register with (H3). Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first of its kind in the context of France and the European Union to focus on job crafting and its effect on both meaningful work and the affective commitment of non-traditional workers. This paper contributes by filling a gap in human resource (HR) management, in which empirical studies that address gig work have been limited so far.",art

Purpose Although common throughout the world, little is known about the mechanism by which nepotism is associated with employee outcomes. Drawing from social exchange theory, this study examines whether fear-based silence mediates the relationship between nepotism with employee workplace withdrawal and career satisfaction. In addition, whether gender moderates the relationship between nepotism and fear-based silence is also examined. Design/methodology/approach Two time-lagged surveys of 330 employees in the Indian banking sector were completed. Findings As hypothesized, nepotism was positively related to fear-based silence and employee workplace withdrawal; it was negatively related to career satisfaction. Fear-based silence partially mediated the relationships of nepotism with workplace withdraw and career satisfaction. Gender moderated the relationship between nepotism and fear-based silence. Practical implications This study shows the negative impact of nepotism on employee outcomes and suggests means for reducing its prevalence in organizations. Originality/value This is the first study to examine fear-based silence as a mediator of nepotism's relationship with employee workplace withdrawal and career satisfaction. It also answers repeated calls for more research on fear-based silence and its antecedents.",art

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the interplay between human resource management (HRM) and emergent factors in constructing a strong HRM climate. Specifically, the paper aims to shed light on how employee perceptions of the HRM process and emergent factors together construct a strong HRM climate, i.e. employees' shared perceptions of HRM. Design/methodology/approach The paper uses qualitative interview data (managers and employees) from two organisations operating in Finland. The data are analysed based on a systematic data analysis and gives an illustration of the interplay between high-performance work system and the emergent factors. Findings The findings illustrate the three types of interplay between HPWS and emergent factors - supplementation, substitution and suffocation - that construct employee experience. Originality/value The paper extends earlier discussions on the relationship between HRM and employee experience by empirically examining how the HRM process - together with emergent factors - constructs a strong HRM climate. The present study contributes to further theorising and increasing our understanding of the creation of employee experience.",art

Purpose Achieving organizational-level outcomes through human resource practices (HRP) as the basis of nearly all organizational improvements has remained relatively unexplored, which requires more investigations. Therefore, the present study aimed to develop a framework to theorize how high-performance work systems (HPWS) can provide organizations with critical instruments for organizational learning (OL) creation that in turn leads to innovation performance (IP). Design/methodology/approach Survey-based, multisource research was designed to examine the proposed model, using the data collected from 154 pharmaceutical industry-related companies. Findings According to the study results, HPWS concentrating on enhancing practices of abilities, motivations and opportunities (AMO) were positively associated with OL, which could in turn improve IP. Moreover, innovation culture (IC) showed a significant moderating effect on the association between OL and IP. Originality/value The central originality of this research first is that HPWS acts as antecedents of OL capabilities contributing to firm-level IP; second, the relationship between OL and firm IP is contingent upon the level of IC in organizations.",art

Purpose This study aims to explore cross-border and sedentary workers' job satisfaction, analyzing the role played by employability dimensions (occupational expertise, anticipation/optimization and personal flexibility), a job resource (autonomy) and job demands (job insecurity and toxic leadership), using the job demands-resources (JD-R) model as a theoretical framework. Moreover, this study tried to detect possible discrepancies between the two subsamples. Design/methodology/approach The study involved a sample of 250 employees, 40% of whom were frontier workers. Data were collected with a self-report questionnaire and analyzed with SPSS 25. A hierarchical regression analysis and t-test for independent samples were performed. Findings The findings evidenced differences between the two subsamples concerning the job satisfaction predictors. Specifically, for cross-border workers, optimization/anticipation appeared significantly positively related to job satisfaction. For sedentary workers, toxic leadership and job insecurity were significantly negatively related to job satisfaction. Autonomy was positively related to the outcome for both samples. Furthermore, cross-border workers reported a higher level of optimization/anticipation, personal flexibility and job satisfaction than sedentary workers. Originality/value This paper contributed to fill a gap currently present in the literature on the cross-border population, with a specific focus on job satisfaction. This study confirmed the existence of peculiar working dynamics for cross-border workers.",art

Purpose This study set out to investigate the role of self-determination and accountability in the relationship between empowering leadership, motivation and performance. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 172 participants working in an international software development organization. Hypotheses were tested in PROCESS using the Preacher and Hayes (2008) bootstrapping method. Findings Results indicate that empowering leadership played a significant role satisfying basic psychological needs. As expected, the satisfaction of needs is related to autonomous motivation. Crucially, perceived accountability was also positively related to autonomous motivation. Research limitations/implications The cross-sectional design of this study limits the ability to rule out the possibility of reverse causation. Practical implications The results suggest that traditional management practices such as accountability can be successfully utilized in conjunction with self-determination theory without undermining autonomous motivation. This study highlights two key opportunities for human resources (HR) professionals. Specifically, by equipping managers with the skills to display empowering leadership behaviors, and by communicating organizational values and individual job meaning to enhance identified forms of motivation, HR can fully realize the benefits of autonomous employee motivation. Originality/value This paper offers valuable insight into how leaders can balance the satisfaction of basic psychological needs with accountability to influence autonomous motivation in employees. The model presented demonstrates the potential of empowering leadership in achieving this balance and highlights the importance of identified motivation as a powerful correlate of work performance.",art

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the non-linear effects of work engagement (WE) on the job outcomes' creative performance (CRP), extra-role customer service (ERCS) and turnover intention (TI). Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 405 millennial frontline employees (FLEs) working in the hospitality industry in Kenya. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the hypothesized relationships. Findings The results yielded support for one relationship. WE was found to have a significant non-linear relationship with TI. This finding provides evidence of a ceiling to the positive impact of WE on reduced TI. WE and CRP and ERCS were however found to be non-significant and linear, and significant and linear, respectively. Research limitations/implications A large number of studies have evidenced positive individual and organizational outcomes associated with WE. This study however, is important, as the dark side of WE is empirically examined, therefore providing a different perspective of the concept. Practical implications The study findings affirm that management must exercise caution with excess levels of WE among millennial FLEs as this may lead to unfavourable outcomes. Originality/value In this research, the assumption of linearity is challenged. Empirical evidence for the need to systematically explore non-linear associations for a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between variables is provided. Moreover, this study is among the few in which the presence of curvilinear relations between WE and job outcomes is examined in a non-Western context.",art
10.1002/hrm.22266,"Thriving for Nothing? The Hidden Costs of Thriving for Employees With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Their Employers. Research has shown that thriving at work leads to positive outcomes for both organizations and employees. A critical element of thriving is self-regulation, which enables employees to effectively manage their emotions and behaviors in alignment with their long-term goals. However, there is a limited understanding of how employees experience thriving when self-regulation is impaired. In this article, we integrate thriving theory and one of its central elements, self-regulation, with research on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) which has shown that the condition is associated with reduced and sometimes severely impaired self-regulation. Empirically, we explore how employees with ADHD experience thriving at work using a qualitative study of working individuals. In contrast to previous findings, our study uncovers a dark side of thriving for employees with ADHD, with negative consequences for their wellbeing and growth opportunities, and ultimately an increased likelihood of voluntary quitting. In our analysis, we explain why, despite an initial positive boost in productivity, thriving ends up being a harmful process for employees with ADHD. We argue that low self-regulation, together with low self-esteem and fear of failure, drive them to work excessively and neglect caring for themselves and their families. We develop recommendations for employees with ADHD and their companies to stop this negative downward spiral.",art
10.1002/hrm.22262,"It Matters How You Got There and Who Else Is Doing It: Examining the Effects of Two Social-Contextual Characteristics of Working From Home. Drawing on self-determination theory, this study advances our understanding of employees' experiences working from home (WFH). Specifically, we examine the effects of two social-contextual characteristics of WFH arrangements: whether employees voluntarily initiate their arrangement (WFH initiation) and the proportion of WFH employees in a unit (WFH density). We conducted multilevel analyses on a multisource dataset drawn from organizational HR records and two surveys of 2115 WFH employees in a Fortune 500 organization. Employees who voluntarily initiated WFH, rather than at their employer's direction, experienced higher job autonomy and lower isolation. WFH employees in units with a lower proportion of other WFH employees experienced higher job autonomy. WFH initiation and WFH density also had effects on several distal employee outcomes, including job satisfaction, organizational knowledge, and turnover intentions, through their effects on job autonomy and isolation. Our findings provide valuable insight into the experiences of WFH employees and call attention to two important, yet understudied, factors that shape these experiences.",art
10.1002/hrm.22200,"The SMART model of work design: A higher order structure to help see the wood from the trees. We propose a new work design model, SMART work design, that identifies five higher order categories of work characteristics, including stimulating work characteristics (task variety, skill variety, information processing requirements, and problem-solving requirements), mastery work characteristics (job feedback, feedback from others, and role clarity), autonomous work characteristics (decision-making autonomy, timing autonomy, and method autonomy), relational work characteristics (social support, task significance, and beneficiary contact), and tolerable work characteristics (low levels of: role overload, work-home conflict, and role conflict). Higher order confirmatory factor analysis of working participants provided initial evidence of this structure (Study 1, N = 1107), which was replicated in an additional dataset (Study 2, time 1, N = 709). To provide further evidence, we examined Study 2 data across three waves (N = 573) to show that each higher order factor at time 1 predicted time 3 job satisfaction either directly or via the theorized time 2 mediators (challenge appraisals, work meaningfulness, fulfillment of relatedness needs, and activated negative affect). In Study 3 (N = 108), employees' scores on specific higher order variables correlated with leader ratings of performance in the expected ways. The SMART work design model provides a unique integrating and multidimensional theory of work design that extends beyond existing models. The model can be used to facilitate the synthesis of research knowledge and guide scholars and practitioners to diagnose and address contemporary work design challenges.",art
10.1002/hrm.22164,"When firms adopt sustainable human resource management: A fuzzy-set analysis. Sustainable human resource management (HRM) is critical to sustainable corporate development. However, there is little systematic research examining the determinants of sustainable HRM adoption. We fill this void by identifying and introducing a configurational approach to examine when firms adopt sustainable HRM. Based on institutional theory, we develop a typology of institutional contexts associated with sustainable HRM adoption. We posit that institutional conditions in configuration facilitate firms' adoption of sustainable HRM. Thus, we hypothesize a primary institutional configuration where institutional support, institutional quality, and institutional infrastructure combine to promote the adoption of sustainable HRM. We further propose alternative types of configurations conducive to the adoption of sustainable HRM by introducing two organizational conditions: strategic leadership support and resource slack. A fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis on data from 57 cases in China supports our hypotheses. We find that the combination of institutional conditions promotes the adoption of highly sustainable HRM, and the two alternative types provide functional substitutes for the primary type: (a) strategic leadership support substitutes for the combination of institutional support and institutional infrastructure, and (b) resource slack substitutes for institutional infrastructure. We build an institutional configurational model to advance a holistic understanding of the theoretical drivers of sustainable HRM, contributing to the research on sustainable HRM, institutional theory, leadership, and resource slack.",art
10.1002/hrm.22159,"Gender diversity advantage at middle management: Implications for high performance work system improvement and organizational performance. Research on women in leadership positions has largely focused on the board or top management team (TMT) leadership level, showing that increased female representation at these levels can benefit organizational performance. However, the strategic implications of female representation at middle management have been largely neglected. The current study addresses this issue in relation to High Performance Work System (HPWS) improvement and organizational performance (profitability). By analyzing the multi-wave (2009, 2011, and 2013) Workplace Panel Survey (WPS) data collected from 1101 organizations in South Korea, we found a gender diversity advantage at middle management; that is, a higher level of gender diversity of middle management translated into a higher level of organizational performance due to HPWS improvement. However, this advantage appeared only in the presence of a high level of subordinates' gender diversity. Our findings have important implications for gender diversity and strategic human resource management.",art
10.1002/hrm.22155,"Regulatory focus climate, organizational structure, and employee ambidexterity: An interactive multilevel model. Prior research suggests that the organizational context supports the emergence of employee ambidexterity; however, the interplay between formal and informal context has been largely unexplored. We analyze this interplay with a multilevel, multisource data set of 2446 individual employees nested in 77 organizations. We find that a promotion climate-unlike a prevention climate-contributes to employee ambidexterity. In addition, formalization positively moderates the effects of both promotion and prevention climate on employee ambidexterity, while centralization weakens the positive effect of promotion climate. Our results advance a contingency perspective that brings together formal and informal contextual drivers of employee ambidexterity and shows that even though an informal climate signals the preferred manner of goal pursuit, a formal structure affects the impact of such signals by delineating opportunity corridors of admissible behaviors.",art

PurposeThe study draws on emerging research on declining employee mental health, particularly employees with low educational attainment, in human resource management (HRM) and health and tests whether labor market institutions are empirically associated with better mental health among workers from different educational backgrounds.Design/methodology/approachThis study draws on a large national sample of part- and full-time workers and models a conditional relationship between labor market institutions and employee self-rated mental health using ordinary least squares (OLS) models with fixed effects.FindingsThe findings indicate membership in a labor market institution such as a union is positively associated with improved employee mental health, but the relationship is moderated by educational attainment. Union membership is associated with better mental health among employees with low educational attainment and appears to bring these workers up to a level of mental health that is comparable to more highly educated workers, thereby reducing mental health inequality. However, union membership has no effect on the mental health of more highly educated employees.Originality/valueDespite the recognition that declining worker mental health presents challenges for workers, organizations and society, systematic empirical research on institutional mechanisms that may affect mental health is limited. This study draws on data of part- and full-time workers to model the relationship with a sample large enough to specify conditional models to account for heterogeneous relationships conditional on workers' educational attainment.

PurposeBuilding on the conservation of resources theory, this research explored the processes underlying the association between perceived workplace incivility and deviant behaviors. Specifically, we tested a mediating mechanism, an interpersonal conflict that has received less consideration in the workplace incivility literature. The authors also tested the organizational climate (i.e. a resource) as a moderator in the perceived workplace incivility-employees' deviant work behavior relationship.Design/methodology/approachTime-lagged research design was followed to explain the relationship of variables. Survey data were collected at time 1 and time 2 from 220 service sector working professionals to test the proposed model.FindingsThe findings suggest that intrapersonal conflict partially mediates the workplace incivility-deviant work behavior relationship.

PurposeBased on the job demands and resources (JD-R) model and conservation of resources (COR) theory, this paper aims to develop and test a model that examines the moderating role of daily remote work hours and the mediating role of work-family conflict on the effects of excessive workload and time pressure on life satisfaction due to mandatory remote work arrangements.Design/methodology/approachHierarchical regression analysis was used to analyze data from 400 professionals working in the IT sector in Turkey. Scales developed by previous researchers were used to measure excessive workload, time pressure, work-family conflict and life satisfaction. While these four variables were measured with 19 statements, daily remote work hours were determined with a single question. The collected data were validated using confirmatory factor analysis, and the hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. Furthermore, the reliability and validity of the data were confirmed. Finally, PROCESS was applied to examine moderated mediation.FindingsAccording to the analysis results obtained from the above sample data, daily remote work hours moderate the mediating role of work-family conflict in the relationships between (1) excessive workload and life satisfaction and (2) time pressure and life satisfaction. In other words, the findings show that job-related demands arising from workload, time pressure and remote work hours prevent employees from meeting their family obligations, thereby increasing work-family conflict and ultimately affecting life satisfaction.Practical implicationsThe study can help employers, managers, human resource professionals, policymakers and researchers increase employees' life satisfaction due to the changes in job demands experienced by employees in companies that have transitioned to remote work practices. It can provide new approaches for dealing with dissatisfaction arising from work-related conflicts in Turkey's changing environment. The results can greatly facilitate the Turkish companies' efforts to create more innovative work arrangements and make an outstanding contribution to improving employee performance in Turkey's transition to remote work practices by focusing on reducing workload, time pressure and long working hours and creating employee-centered remote work models.Originality/valueAs per World Health Organization, the world will face frequent pandemic in the coming years, and thus organizations should be aware of remote work practices that will become widespread. This study provides a new perspective on the impact of employees' changing job demands on work-family conflict and life satisfaction during organizations' transition to new work arrangements in the face of the social crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Purpose This study examines how satisfaction with work-life balance (WLB) in combination with satisfaction with organization's COVID-19 responses (SOCV19R) helps to enhance subjective well-being and performance during the lockdown due to COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach The data of this time-lagged study were gathered through an online survey with three-waves between March and May 2020 in Spain (N = 167). Hierarchical multiple regression and PROCESS were used to test the hypotheses. Findings Direct relationships between SOCV19R and subjective well-being and performance were not significant. Instead, SOCV19R increased employees' well-being and performance through a higher satisfaction with WLB (full mediation). Originality/value The novelty of this study is the evaluation of SOCV19R as a form of organizational support in times of crisis. This study suggests that a good organizational reaction to face a crisis such as the pandemic, encourages employees' WLB and helps them to boost their well-being and performance. It may be concluded that work-life balance (WLB) in Spain was seen as a luxury in good times and turned out to be a necessity in bad times.

Purpose This study explores the role of intrinsic work values as a motivator in the workplace. By integrating the job demands-resources model and supplies-values fit theory, it also investigates whether autonomy and worker co-operatives can strengthen the intrinsic motivation of employees who have strong intrinsic work values. Design/methodology/approach Longitudinal surveys collected at 25 worker co-operatives and 27 corporations were analyzed with a model in which a moderated mediation model and a mediated moderation model are integrated. Findings The results revealed that individuals with strong intrinsic work values had stronger intrinsic motivation and engaged less frequently in job search behavior. The moderation analyses demonstrated that employees with strong intrinsic work values were more strongly motivated in worker co-operatives than in corporations and that this result was obtained because more autonomy was granted in worker co-operatives than in corporations. Research limitations/implications To date, little research has examined the moderating roles of autonomy and worker co-ops in the associations of intrinsic work values with employee motivation and behavior. The present study contributes to the literature on work values and worker co-operatives by providing evidence that autonomy and worker co-operatives can accelerate intrinsic motivation of employees with intrinsic work values. Practical implications Managers should grant employees enough autonomy and opportunities to participate in decision-making to stimulate their motivation, especially for employees with strong intrinsic work values.

The proposed models were tested with hierarchical linear modeling and Monte Carlo simulation. Findings The results show a significant interactive effect of HPWS and LMX on job engagement and proactive behavior. In addition, job engagement serves as a vital mechanism linking the interactive effect of HPWS and LMX quality on proactive behavior. Originality/value This study uses signaling theory to unpack the question when and how HPWS can be more influential on employees' proactive behavior. In particular, the positive effect of HPWS on proactive behavior is more prominent only when employees enjoy high LMX quality with their respective line managers. In addition, the interactive effects of HPWS and LMX quality on proactive behavior are mediated by job engagement. The findings provide valuable theoretical and managerial contribution by integrating HRM and leadership research.",art

Purpose A retrospective action-research case study of one branch of the University and College Union (UCU) is used to show how threshold requirements of the Act can be systematically beaten. Design/methodology/approach The paper responds to calls for best practice on how trade unions may react to member voting threshold requirements of the Trade Union Act 2016 (the Act). A broader aim is to make a theoretical contribution related to trade union organising and tactics in get the vote out (GTVO) industrial action organising campaigns. Findings Findings are presented as a lead organiser's first-hand account of a successful GTVO campaign contextualised in relation to theories of organising. The findings offer best practice for union organisers required to beat the Act's voting thresholds and also contribute to theories surrounding trade union organising tactics. Research limitations/implications Further development and adaptation of the proposed model may be required when applied to larger bargaining units and different organising contexts. Practical implications The findings can inform the organising practices/tactics of trade unions in relation to statutory ballots. The findings also allow Human Resource (HR) practitioners to reflect on their approach to dealing with unions capable of mounting successful GTVO campaigns. Social implications The findings have the potential to collectively empower workers, via their trade unions, to defend and further their interests in a post-financial crisis context and in the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic. Originality/value This is the first known empirical account of organising to exceed voting thresholds of the Act, providing practical steps for union organisers in planning for statutory ballots. Further value lies in the paper's use of a novel first-hand account of a GTVO campaign, offering a new and first, theoretical model of organising tactics to beat the Act.",art

Purpose This paper presents a typology exploring employers' perceptions of the quality of available applicants and employers decisions to buy qualified staff vs. to hire available workers and then make i.e. develop them via employer-supported training. Design/methodology/approach This study uses 2015 survey data from Southwestern Ontario, Canada, based on responses from 834 employers regarding their hiring, separations, training and other HRM policies. Findings Among surveyed employers, 10% are Reliants who found the quality of available applicants to be low, yet these employers do not provide employee training. Almost half of employers (at 45%) are Developers who find the quality of applicants to be low but they do provide employee training. Approximately, 7% of employers are Poachers who find that the quality of applicants is high and do not provide employee training, while 38% are Refiners, who find the quality of applicants is high and they provide employee training. Originality/value Employers need to make their training decisions in alignment with their assessment of the quality of job applicants to whom they have access. In this paper, decisions on training and applicant quality are considered concurrently. From an academic viewpoint, the findings raise the issue as to whether other stakeholders (such as educational institutions) are sufficiently helping individuals gain the skills, credentials and work experiences that employers are seeking. If job openings are remaining unfilled because employers are unwilling to hire those available, then applicants lose, employers lose and societies lose.",art
10.1108/PR-12-2020-0878,"Employee perceptions of HRM system strength: examining outcome and boundary conditions among HR and non-HR employees. Purpose Studies have explored perceptions of human resource management (HRM) system strength and how they can relate to employee-level outcomes. However, the authors understand little about the boundary conditions for such relationships. Here, the authors apply signaling theory to explain the relationship between HRM system strength and affective commitment as well as the role of an organization's communication climate and organizational collectivism. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted an initial study among HR practitioners (N = 115) to determine their perception of HRM system strength, its outcomes and boundary conditions. The authors then conducted a second study to increase the reliability of our earlier findings by focusing on non-HR employees (N = 179). Findings The findings in both studies indicate that employee perceptions of HRM system strength positively and significantly relate to affective commitment. Moreover, the results show support for the moderating roles of both communication climate and organizational collectivism. These findings are novel and extend the nomological network of employee perceived HRM system strength. Originality/value These findings offer valuable practical insights regarding approaches to strengthen the relationship between HRM system strength and affective commitment. In particular, we offer practical recommendations pointing to the relevance of improving the communication climate as well as the sense of belonging within the organization (organizational collectivism).",art
10.1108/PR-04-2020-0254,"Human resources strategy as a catalyst for the success of the competitive strategy: an analysis based on alignment. Purpose Competitive strategy is one of the key factors traditionally related to performance, but research explaining the mechanisms through which this strategy improves business results is scant. This study aims to shed light on this relationship by analyzing human resource management (HRM) strategy as an essential tool for transforming business strategy into results. Design/methodology/approach Focusing on two generic competitive strategies, the authors establish hypotheses on the need for alignment among four echelons: business strategy, HRM system objectives, HRM system capabilities and business performance. The authors test these hypotheses with structural equation modeling techniques using data provided by 204 industrial companies. Findings The results show that to get the most out of a competitive strategy based on quality differentiation, HRM system objectives and capabilities must be focussed on quality. In the same way, a competitive strategy based on innovation differentiation requires HRM system objectives and capabilities focussed on flexibility to achieve the maximum impact on performance. In this second case, alignment is fundamental in low dynamic environments. Originality/value This research not only provides additional evidence for the strategic relevance of the human resources (HR) function but also reveals the potential benefits of focusing on objectives and capabilities rather than on practices. Moreover, it shows that the role of HRM objectives and capabilities in the implementation of a competitive strategy can be shaped by factors beyond the company's control, such as environmental dynamism.",art

Purpose The purpose of the current study is to investigate occupational stereotypes among a professional sample of recruiters and other employees on the two fundamental dimensions of warmth and competence. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a survey to collect professionals ' (mostly recruiters ') ratings of preselected occupations. Participants were asked to rate warmth and competence attributes. Factor and cluster analysis were employed to investigate the two-dimensional structure of the warmth/competence space and how and whether occupations cluster as predicted by the stereotype content model (SCM). Findings Almost all occupations showed a clear two-factorial structure, corresponding to the warmth/competence dimensions. A five-cluster solution was deemed appropriate as depicting how occupations disperse on these dimensions. Implications for stereotyping research, the design of hiring discrimination experiments, and HRM are discussed. Originality/value In contrast to previous related research, in which participants select the included occupations themselves, the authors included prespecified common occupations, which should be important for representativeness. In addition, previous research has been conducted in the United States, while the authors conduct this study in a European context (Sweden). Finally, instead of studying students or participants with unspecified work experience, the authors focus on professionals (mostly recruiters).",art

Purpose The paper examines the compatibility of two UK policy priorities - extending working life (EWL) and the promotion of national economic performance through high performance work practices (HPWP). Design/methodology/approach Empirical analysis has been conducted using data from WERS2011 to test hypotheses on whether age moderates the link between HPWP and employee well-being outcomes. Findings Development-oriented human resource strategies are found to compromise the wellbeing of older workers relative to younger ones, while some dimensions of HPWP lead to more favourable wellbeing outcomes for older workers relative to their younger counterparts (flexible working, performance-related pay and appraisal systems). Research limitations/implications At older ages those still in the workforce may be over-represented by happier and psychologically more robust individuals who have settled into jobs they find fulfilling, matching their personal characteristics and abilities. If so, the adverse well-being influence of development-oriented strategies may be understated, while favourable well-being outcomes for older workers may be overstated. Practical implications HRM strategies may need to be more age sensitive to support the EWL agenda better. Originality/value While many studies have examined the link between HPWP and a range of individual-level outcomes, less widely researched is whether responses vary by age, which the paper addresses.",art
10.1108/PR-05-2020-0340,"Investigating leadership and employee well-being in higher education. Purpose-This article aims to understand the underlying mechanisms through which transformational leadership influences employee job satisfaction and turnover intentions. Specifically, the study explores the mediation role of employee well-being on the relationships between leadership and both employee job satisfaction and turnover intentions.Design/methodology/approach-Employing a quantitative research method, data were collected from 280 academics and professional staff from an Australian regional university. The Mplus software was used for data analysis.Findings-The results showed that transformational leadership had significant positive impact on employee well-being and job satisfaction while it alleviated employee turnover intentions. Furthermore, employee well-being mediated the effect of transformational leadership on employee job satisfaction and turnover intentions.Research limitations/implications-The research was cross-sectional, and data were collected from a convenient sample and therefore minimises our ability to generalise the findings to other contexts.Practical implications-Effective leadership, employee well-being, job satisfaction and employee turnover are of strategic importance in the higher education sector in Australia and internationally. These findings will therefore provide a basis for university policy makers to craft relevant policies that promote effective leader behaviours and enhance employee well-being as they facilitate employee job satisfaction and minimise turnover intentions among higher education sector employees (i.e. academics and professional staff).Originality/value-Our study provides a unique contribution to knowledge as it explains the mediation effect of employee well-being on the relation between transformational leadership a, job satisfaction and turnover intentions.",art

This research examined the influence of mentorship quality on work-to-family positive spillover (WFPS) of mentors by focusing on the mediating role of personal skill development and the moderating role of core self-evaluations (CSEs). The findings based on a survey study of 187 formal Chinese mentors indicated that the positive linkage between mentorship quality and WFPS is mediated by personal skill development. In addition, the influences of mentorship quality on personal skill development is stronger for mentors whose CSE is high rather than low. These results evidence that a formal mentoring program has positive impacts on the family life of mentors in an Eastern setting.",art
10.1109/CVPRW.2019.00007,"Privacy-Preserving Action Recognition using Coded Aperture Videos. The risk of unauthorized remote access of streaming video from networked cameras underlines the need for stronger privacy safeguards. We propose a lens free coded aperture camera system for human action recognition that is privacy-preserving. While coded aperture systems exist, we believe ours is the first system designed for action recognition without the need for image restoration as an intermediate step. Action recognition is done using a deep network that takes in as input, non-invertible motion features between pairs offrames computed using phase correlation and log-polar transformation. Phase correlation encodes translation while the log polar transformation encodes in plane rotation and scaling. We show that the translation features are independent of the coded aperture design, as long as its spectral response within the bandwidth has no zeros. Stacking motion features computed on frames at multiple different strides in the video can improve accuracy. Preliminary results on simulated data based on a subset of the UCF and NTU datasets are promising. We also describe our prototype lens free coded aperture camera system, and results for real captured videos are mixed.",art
